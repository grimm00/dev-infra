# Plan Review Command

Reviews implementation plans before work begins. Ensures the plan is complete, dependencies are satisfiable, and task groups are ready for implementation.

---

## Configuration

**Plan Path Detection:**

This command reads the uniform planning structure (`implementation-plan.md` + `tasks/`):

1. **Dev-Infra Structure:**
   - Plan: `admin/planning/features/[feature-name]/implementation-plan.md`
   - Tasks: `admin/planning/features/[feature-name]/tasks/`
   - Status: `admin/planning/features/[feature-name]/status-and-next-steps.md`

2. **Template Project Structure (generated projects):**
   - Plan: `docs/maintainers/planning/features/[feature-name]/implementation-plan.md`
   - Tasks: `docs/maintainers/planning/features/[feature-name]/tasks/`
   - Status: `docs/maintainers/planning/features/[feature-name]/status-and-next-steps.md`

**Feature Detection:**

- Use `--feature` option if provided
- Otherwise, auto-detect:
  - Check if planning features directory exists (dev-infra or template project)
  - If single feature exists, use that feature name
  - If multiple features exist, prompt user to select
  - If no features exist, report error

**Legacy Fallback:**

If `implementation-plan.md` is not found but `feature-plan.md` + `phase-*.md` exist:

```
⚠️ Legacy phase structure detected for feature '[name]'.
   Use `/pre-phase-review` for phase-based plans, or migrate first.
   See docs/MIGRATION-v0.10.md
```

## Workflow Overview

**When to use:**

- Before starting implementation of a new group
- After plan generation (`/transition-plan`) is complete
- To validate plan readiness
- To identify missing dependencies or gaps
- To check consistency between plan, task files, and status

**Key principle:** Review planning documents to ensure implementation readiness before beginning work. Catches issues that are cheaper to fix in planning than in code.

---

## Usage

**Command:** `/plan-review [feature] [options]`

**Examples:**

- `/plan-review workflow-simplification` — Review entire plan
- `/plan-review workflow-simplification --group 2` — Review only Group 2
- `/plan-review --feature my-feature --check-deps` — Focus on dependencies
- `/plan-review --dry-run` — Show review without creating files

**Options:**

- `--feature [name]` — Specify feature name (overrides auto-detection)
- `--group [N]` — Review only group N (by index in the groups array, 1-based)
- `--check-deps` — Focus on dependency validation
- `--check-tests` — Focus on test plan validation
- `--dry-run` — Show review without creating files

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Load and Parse Implementation Plan

**What to do:**

1. Locate `implementation-plan.md` using path detection rules above.

2. Parse YAML frontmatter:
   - `task_count` — total number of tasks
   - `groups[]` — array of group objects (name, file, tasks)
   - `tasks_files[]` — list of task group file paths

3. Verify frontmatter integrity:
   - [ ] `task_count` matches the total number of tasks across all groups
   - [ ] Every task number 1 to `task_count` appears exactly once in `groups[].tasks[]`
   - [ ] All files in `tasks_files[]` exist on disk
   - [ ] `groups[].file` paths match `tasks_files[]`

4. Read the checkbox list in the Implementation Plan section:
   - [ ] Count `- [ ]` (incomplete) and `- [x]` (complete) entries
   - [ ] Verify checkbox count matches `task_count`

**If `--group N` specified:** Only load the Nth group file for detailed review.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Implementation plan found and readable
- [ ] YAML frontmatter parses correctly
- [ ] Frontmatter is internally consistent
- [ ] All referenced task files exist
- [ ] Checkbox counts match task_count

---

### 2. Review Task Group Files

**For each group file (or the specified `--group`):**

1. **Structure check:**
   - [ ] File has proper header (Feature, Group, Status, Last Updated)
   - [ ] `## 📝 Tasks` section exists
   - [ ] Tasks are listed with descriptions
   - [ ] `## 🔗 Dependencies` section exists (can be empty)

2. **Task descriptions:**
   - [ ] Each task has a clear description (not just a title)
   - [ ] Tasks have enough detail for implementation
   - [ ] Goals or acceptance criteria are identifiable

3. **Group sizing:**
   - Flag if a group has >8 tasks (may be too large; consider splitting)
   - Flag if a group has <2 tasks (may be too granular; consider merging)
   - Note: these are warnings, not blockers

4. **Task numbering:**
   - [ ] Task numbers in the group file match the frontmatter `tasks[]` array
   - [ ] No duplicate task numbers
   - [ ] No gaps in numbering

**Checklist:**

- [ ] All group files have required structure
- [ ] Task descriptions are adequate
- [ ] Group sizes are reasonable
- [ ] Task numbering is consistent

---

### 3. Validate Dependencies

**Check inter-task dependencies:**

1. **Within groups:**
   - Are tasks within a group ordered logically?
   - Are internal dependencies satisfiable (earlier task before later)?

2. **Across groups:**
   - Do cross-group dependencies point to tasks in earlier groups?
   - Flag any circular dependencies.
   - Flag any dependency on a task in a later group (potential ordering issue).

3. **External dependencies:**
   - Are there references to external tools, libraries, or configurations?
   - Are those dependencies available or documented?

4. **Prerequisite completion:**
   - For groups with `🟠 In Progress` or `🔴 Not Started` status, are all prerequisite groups complete?

**Checklist:**

- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Cross-group dependencies are forward-only (earlier groups first)
- [ ] External dependencies documented
- [ ] Prerequisites satisfiable

---

### 4. Check Consistency

**Cross-document consistency:**

1. **Plan vs. Status:**
   - [ ] Checkbox counts in `implementation-plan.md` match progress in `status-and-next-steps.md`
   - [ ] Group statuses in status file reflect actual task completion
   - [ ] Overall progress count is accurate

2. **Plan vs. Task Files:**
   - [ ] Task titles in plan match task descriptions in group files
   - [ ] No orphan tasks (in group file but not in plan)
   - [ ] No phantom tasks (in plan but not in any group file)

3. **Frontmatter vs. Content:**
   - [ ] `task_count` matches actual checkbox count
   - [ ] Group task ranges are contiguous and cover all tasks

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Plan and status are in sync
- [ ] Plan and task files are in sync
- [ ] Frontmatter matches content

---

### 5. Identify Issues and Gaps

**Categories:**

1. **Blockers (must fix before implementation):**
   - Missing task files
   - Broken task numbering
   - Circular dependencies
   - Inconsistent task counts

2. **Warnings (should fix, not blocking):**
   - Oversized groups (>8 tasks)
   - Undersized groups (<2 tasks)
   - Tasks with only a title and no description
   - Stale status indicators
   - Missing dependency sections

3. **Recommendations (optional improvements):**
   - Better task breakdown suggestions
   - TDD pairing opportunities
   - Documentation improvements

---

### 6. Generate Review Report

**Location:**

- Dev-infra: `admin/planning/features/[feature-name]/plan-review-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Template project: `docs/maintainers/planning/features/[feature-name]/plan-review-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Report structure:**

```markdown

## Common Issues

### Issue: Task File Missing

```
❌ BLOCKER: Task file not found: tasks/03-command-logic-updates.md
   Referenced by frontmatter groups[2].file
   Fix: Create the file or update the frontmatter reference.
```

### Issue: Task Count Mismatch

```
❌ BLOCKER: Frontmatter says task_count: 18 but found 16 checkboxes.
   Fix: Update frontmatter or add missing tasks.
```

### Issue: Oversized Group

```
⚠️ WARNING: Group "Template Assets" has 9 tasks (recommended max: 8).
   Consider splitting into two groups for manageability.
```

### Issue: Status Drift

```
⚠️ WARNING: Status file shows 5/18 complete but plan has 3 checked boxes.
   Fix: Sync the status file with the implementation plan.
```

## Tips

**Before review:**
- Ensure plan generation is complete (`/transition-plan`)
- Have task group files populated (at least scaffolded)
- Check that status file exists

**During review:**
- Pay special attention to cross-group dependencies
- Verify task descriptions have enough detail for the AI to implement
- Check that TDD tasks are properly paired (RED + GREEN)

**After review:**
- Use `/address-review [path]` to fix identified issues
- Re-run `/plan-review` after addressing blockers
- Proceed to `/task next` when status is ✅ Ready

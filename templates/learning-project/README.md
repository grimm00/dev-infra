## 📄 Project Metadata (`.dev-infra.yml`)

This project includes a **`.dev-infra.yml`** file at the repository root. It records the dev-infra template type, generation version, and an **`expected_skills`** manifest — the workflow skills this template assumes you have installed globally.

- **Not a bundle:** Templates no longer ship skill or command copies; the manifest declares expectations only.
- **Validation:** `proj-cli` setup will **warn** (not error) when listed skills are missing and point you to the external skill corpus.
- **Reference:** Schema and canonical skill inventory live in the dev-infra repo [`docs/DEV-INFRA-YML.md`](https://github.com/grimm00/dev-infra/blob/develop/docs/DEV-INFRA-YML.md) (generated projects link out; dev-infra maintainers edit the doc + template copies together).

Projects work without skills installed — documentation and hub READMEs orient you when skills are absent.

## 🔍 Exploration/Research/Decision Workflows

This project supports structured workflows for exploring ideas, conducting research, and making architectural decisions before transitioning to feature planning.

### Directory Structure

**Hub Directories:**
- `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/` - Exploration hub (created by template)
- `docs/maintainers/research/` - Research hub (created by template)
- `docs/maintainers/decisions/` - Decisions hub (created by template)

**Topic-Specific Directories:**
- Commands (`/explore`, `/research`, `/decision`) create topic-specific directories automatically
- Example: `/explore my-topic` creates `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/my-topic/`
- Example: `/research my-topic` creates `docs/maintainers/research/my-topic/`
- Example: `/decision my-topic` creates `docs/maintainers/decisions/my-topic/`

### Workflow: Exploration → Research → Decision → Planning

1. **Exploration** (`/explore [topic]`)
   - Organize abstract ideas and proof of concepts
   - Identify research topics
   - Creates: `docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/[topic]/`

2. **Research** (`/research [topic]`)
   - Conduct structured research on identified topics
   - Extract functional and non-functional requirements
   - Creates: `docs/maintainers/research/[topic]/` + `requirements.md`

3. **Decision** (`/decision [topic]`)
   - Make architectural decisions based on research
   - Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
   - Creates: `docs/maintainers/decisions/[topic]/` + ADRs

4. **Transition** (`/transition-plan --from-adr`)
   - Transition from decisions to feature planning
   - Creates feature plan and phase documents
   - Ready for implementation with `/task-phase`

### Hub vs Topic-Specific Directories

**Hub Directories:**
- Created by templates (already present in new projects)
- Contain `README.md` files that serve as navigation hubs
- Provide overview and workflow documentation
- List active explorations/research/decisions

**Topic-Specific Directories:**
- Created by commands (`/explore`, `/research`, `/decision`)
- Contain topic-specific documents
- Automatically organized under hub directories
- Commands populate these directories with structured content

### Getting Started

1. **Start exploration:** Use `/explore [topic]` for new ideas
2. **Conduct research:** Use `/research [topic]` to investigate
3. **Make decisions:** Use `/decision [topic]` to document decisions
4. **Plan implementation:** Use `/transition-plan --from-adr` to create plans

### Example Workflow

```
/explore new-feature
  → Creates: docs/maintainers/planning/explorations/new-feature/
  → Identifies research topics

/research new-feature --from-explore new-feature
  → Creates: docs/maintainers/research/new-feature/
  → Extracts requirements

/decision new-feature --from-research
  → Creates: docs/maintainers/decisions/new-feature/
  → Creates ADRs

/transition-plan --from-adr docs/maintainers/decisions/new-feature/adr-001-*.md
  → Creates: docs/maintainers/planning/features/new-feature/
  → Ready for /task-phase
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Improvements

This learning project supports CI/CD improvements for process enhancements and workflow automation.

### CI/CD Improvement Structure

**Location:** `docs/maintainers/planning/ci/[improvement-name]/`

**Key Files:**
- `README.md` - Improvement hub

   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/maintainers/planning/ci/[improvement-name]
   ```

2. **Create improvement plan:**
   - Copy `docs/maintainers/planning/ci/improvement-plan-template.md` as `improvement-plan.md`
   - Fill in improvement details
   - Define implementation steps

3. **Create phase documents:**
   - Create `phase-1.md`, `phase-2.md`, etc.
   - Define tasks and deliverables

4. **Implement improvements:**
   - Use `/task-improvement [N]` to implement phases
   - Use `/pr --ci-improvement [name]` to create PRs

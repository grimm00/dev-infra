# Agent: Group Cycle

Runs the standard group cycle for a task group: plan expansion, task execution,
PR creation, and validation. Designed to run in an isolated **git worktree** so
the human's workspace stays clean for other work.

The human re-enters after validation to review, merge, and address any open
questions the agent surfaced during execution.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `feature` | yes | Feature name (e.g., `agentic-workflow-modernization`) |
| `group` | yes | Group number or name (e.g., `02-discuss-conversion`) |
| `service` | yes | Service path (e.g., `ai-workflow`) |
| `base_branch` | no | Branch to base work on (default: `develop`) |
| `first_group` | no | Set to `true` if this is the first group in a stage (default: `false`) |
| `prior_pr` | no | PR number of the previous group's merged PR (required if not first_group) |

## Skills & Commands

Read these files **before** the step that needs them. Follow each one exactly.

| Step | Skill / Command | Path |
|------|----------------|------|
| Step 0 — post-PR | post-pr | `.cursor/commands/post-pr.md` |
| Step 0 — pre-phase review | pre-phase-review | `.cursor/commands/pre-phase-review.md` |
| Step 1 — plan expansion | transition-plan | `.cursor/commands/transition-plan.md` |
| Step 3 — PR body | update-pr-description | `~/.cursor/skills/update-pr-description/SKILL.md` |
| Step 4 — PR validation | pr-validation | `.cursor/commands/pr-validation.md` (reference only — Step 4 sub-steps are self-contained) |

Paths starting with `.` are relative to the repo root (inside the worktree).
Paths starting with `~/` are global (user home directory).

## Worktree Setup

Before starting the pipeline, create an isolated worktree:

1. Branch name: `feat/[feature]-[group]` (e.g., `feat/agentic-workflow-stage2-research-foundation`)
2. Worktree path: `worktrees/feat-[feature]-[group]` (following project convention: branch `feat/foo` → `worktrees/feat-foo`)
3. Create from base branch:
   ```
   git worktree add worktrees/feat-[name] -b feat/[name] [base_branch]
   ```
4. All subsequent work happens inside the worktree directory.

When the pipeline completes (or stops on a blocker), the worktree stays in place
for the human to inspect. The human removes it after merge.

## Pipeline

### Step 0: Prior Group Closeout (skip if `first_group` is true)

Before starting new work, close out the previous group cycle:

1. **Post-PR:** Read `.cursor/commands/post-pr.md` and follow it for the prior
   group's merged PR (`prior_pr`). Key outputs: status document updates,
   implementation plan checkboxes, deferred Sourcery issue check.

2. **Pre-phase review:** Read `.cursor/commands/pre-phase-review.md` and follow
   it. Review the prior group's task file and any open questions from its PR.
   Note adjustments that affect the current group's scope.

Both of these happen on the worktree branch before plan expansion begins.

### Step 1: Plan Expansion

Read `.cursor/commands/transition-plan.md` and follow its expand semantics. If
the group's task file has tasks without detailed specs (steps, acceptance
criteria, files), expand them.

If Step 0 surfaced adjustments from the prior group, incorporate them during
expansion.

Skip if all tasks already have detailed specs.

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each uncompleted task in the group (in order):

1. Read the task spec
2. Implement the task following the steps and acceptance criteria
3. Verify acceptance criteria are met
4. Mark the task `[x]` in the group file
5. Commit with message: `feat([feature]): complete Task N — [brief description]`

**On failure:** If a task fails (test error, missing dependency, unclear spec)
and 3 attempts don't resolve it, STOP. Report:
- Which task failed
- What was attempted (3 tries)
- The error or blocker
- Suggested resolution for the human

Do NOT skip tasks or reorder them. Do NOT continue past a blocker.

### Step 3: Create PR

Once all tasks in the group are complete:

1. Push the branch
2. Create PR to `develop` using `gh pr create` with a placeholder body
3. Title: `feat([feature]): [Group name] (Group N)`
4. **Generate the PR body (mandatory).** Read `~/.cursor/skills/update-pr-description/SKILL.md`
   and execute every step — gather context, generate four sections (Summary, Why,
   After Merge, Follow-ups), and write back via `gh pr edit --body-file`. After
   the write, verify the body was updated: `gh pr view --json body -q .body`
   must contain `## Summary`. If it still shows the placeholder, re-run. Do not
   leave a placeholder body on the PR.

### Step 4: PR Validation

Wait 60 seconds for CI to start, then validate the PR.

#### 4a. CI Status

```bash
gh pr checks [pr-number]
```

Document passing/failing checks. If a check fails, check the known issues
registry at `admin/planning/ci/multi-environment-testing/known-issues.md`. Known
issues don't block; new failures get 3 retry attempts before stopping.

#### 4b. Sourcery Review (dt-review)

Run the review tool and save output:

```bash
mkdir -p admin/feedback/sourcery
dt-review [pr-number] admin/feedback/sourcery/pr[number].md
```

If `dt-review` is not available (`which dt-review` returns nothing), skip this
sub-step and note it in the report. Do not block on a missing tool.

#### 4c. Priority Matrix

For every comment in the review file, fill out the priority matrix table using
the prescribed tiers:

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerabilities, data loss, breaking changes, test failures |
| HIGH | Performance issues, missing error handling, maintainability concerns |
| MEDIUM | Style improvements, refactoring opportunities, documentation gaps |
| LOW | Naming suggestions, style preferences, optional enhancements |

Each row gets: **Priority**, **Impact**, **Effort**, **Action**.

#### 4d. Act on Findings

**Always fix inline:**
- Priority is CRITICAL or HIGH (any effort)
- Effort is LOW regardless of priority (typos, grammar, one-line fixes — if it
  takes under 5 minutes, just do it)

**Use judgment — weigh and fix inline when it makes sense:**
- HIGH impact + LOW effort, even at MEDIUM or LOW priority — high-leverage
  quick wins are worth doing now, but assess whether the change is safe

**Defer everything else:**
- MEDIUM or LOW priority items at MEDIUM or higher effort — add to
  `admin/feedback/deferred-tasks.md` if the file exists, and note in the PR
  body's Follow-ups section

Commit fixes with: `docs([feature]): address Sourcery feedback — [brief description]`.
If a fix fails after 3 attempts, stop and report (three-strikes rule).

#### 4e. Commit Review Artifacts

Commit the Sourcery review file (with filled matrix) and any deferred-tasks
updates to the PR branch.

### Step 5: Open Questions File

If any open questions were surfaced during execution, write them to:

```
admin/services/[service]/features/[feature]/planning/open-questions.md
```

Format:

```markdown
# Open Questions — [Group Name]

**Generated by:** group-cycle agent
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**PR:** #[number]

---

## Questions

### Q1: [Brief title]

**Context:** [What was happening when this came up]
**Why it matters:** [Impact on current or future work]
**Suggested next step:** [discuss / explore / research / decision]

---

[Repeat for each question]
```

This file is committed to the branch and included in the PR. The human reviews
it alongside the code changes. Questions that get resolved during review can be
deleted; questions that need deeper work get promoted to the appropriate workflow
(explore, research, decision) by the human.

If no open questions surfaced, skip this step entirely — do not create
the file. Questions must come from genuine uncertainty encountered during
task execution (unclear spec, conflicting patterns, design forks). Do NOT
fabricate questions to fill the template.

### Step 6: Report

Present a summary to the human:

```
## Group Cycle Complete: [Group Name]

**Worktree:** worktrees/[name]
**Tasks:** N/N complete
**PR:** #[number] — [title]
**CI:** [passing/failing]
**Review:** [N comments, N fixed inline, N deferred]

### Open Questions
- [N] questions in planning/open-questions.md, or "None — no genuine uncertainties encountered"

### Discoveries
- [Anything unexpected encountered during execution]

### Needs Human Attention
- [ ] Review PR and open questions
- [ ] Merge when satisfied
- [ ] Remove worktree: `git worktree remove worktrees/[name]`
- [ ] [Any other items requiring judgment]
```

## Behavioral Boundaries

- **Natural discovery is expected.** If a task reveals something unexpected
  (a better approach, a missing prerequisite, a design question), note it
  in the PR description and commit message. Don't suppress it. If it needs
  human judgment, add it to the open questions file.
- **Ceremony is the agent's job.** Git operations, PR creation, validation
  scaffolding, status updates — these are mechanical. Do them without asking.
- **Judgment is the human's job.** Design decisions, scope changes, "should
  we do this differently?" — write these as open questions, don't resolve them.
- **Three strikes on errors.** Technical failures (test failures, CI errors,
  command errors) get 3 retry attempts. After that, stop and report.
- **Stay in the worktree.** All file operations happen inside the worktree.
  Do not modify the main workspace.

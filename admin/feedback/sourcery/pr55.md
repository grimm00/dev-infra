## Overall Comments

- The scaffolding template hardcodes multiple instances of `🔴 Scaffolding (needs expansion)` and command examples; consider consolidating status phrasing and command placeholders (`[topic]`, `--phase N`, etc.) to a single canonical pattern to reduce divergence as things evolve.
- In the new Setup Mode and Expand Mode sections, the source types and flows (artifacts, reflection, ADRs, CI/CD, infrastructure) are described slightly differently in various places; it may help to align the terminology and lists so the same categories and naming are used consistently across the file.
- The CI/CD guidance in the phase scaffolding section now omits explicit mention of `/task-improvement`, while the surrounding docs still distinguish CI/CD from feature flows; consider adding a brief note about the intended implementation command for CI/CD phases to keep that path clear.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Overall #1 (Status phrasing) | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | Nice-to-have consistency improvement |
| Overall #2 (Terminology alignment) | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | Consistency across file sections |
| Overall #3 (CI/CD guidance) | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Add brief note about `/task-improvement` |

**Summary:**
- **CRITICAL/HIGH issues:** 0
- **MEDIUM issues:** 1 (deferred - minor documentation consistency)
- **LOW issues:** 2 (deferred - nice-to-have improvements)

**Action:** All issues are documentation style/consistency suggestions. Defer to future iterations. No blocking issues.

## Individual Comments

### Comment #1

**Location**: `tests/unit/check-release-readiness.bats:249-257`

**Type**: issue (testing)

**Description**: Since this test is always skipped, it doesn’t currently protect against regressions. Instead, you could:

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

<b>Code Context</b>

<pre><code>
     [[ &quot;$output&quot; =~ &quot;&lt;/summary&gt;&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; [[ &quot;$output&quot; =~ &quot;&lt;/details&gt;&quot; ]]
 }

+@test &quot;check-release-readiness.sh does not validate HTML structure&quot; {
+    cd &quot;$PROJECT_ROOT&quot;
+    # This test documents that the script does not currently validate HTML structure
+    # If HTML validation is added in the future, this test should be updated
+    # to verify that malformed HTML is detected and reported
+    
+    # For now, we document that the script doesn&#x27;t enforce HTML structure
+    # The script generates HTML but doesn&#x27;t validate it
+    skip &quot;Script does not currently validate HTML structure in output&quot;
+}
+
</code></pre>

<b>Issue</b>

**issue (testing):** Consider making this a non-skipped test that asserts the current behavior with malformed HTML instead of only documenting it

## Overall Comments

- Instead of skipping the new `check-release-readiness.sh does not validate HTML structure` test entirely, consider making it assert the current behavior (e.g., that malformed HTML still yields a zero exit code or unchanged output) so it documents and pins the existing contract while leaving a clear TODO for future validation logic.
- In `new-project.bats` teardown, since `cleanup_test_env` is now the single source of truth for removing the temp tree, it might be worth adding a brief comment near the helper’s definition as well to clarify that it is responsible for all nested test directories, avoiding future reintroduction of redundant cleanup.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

Use this template to assess each comment:

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| #1 | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Test improvement - could assert current behavior instead of skip |
| Overall #1 | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Same as #1 - make test assert current behavior |
| Overall #2 | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Documentation improvement - add comment to helper |

### Priority Levels
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Security, stability, or core functionality issues
- 🟠 **HIGH**: Bug risks or significant maintainability issues
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Code quality and maintainability improvements
- 🟢 **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Impact Levels
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Affects core functionality
- 🟠 **HIGH**: User-facing or significant changes
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Developer experience improvements
- 🟢 **LOW**: Minor improvements

### Effort Levels
- 🟢 **LOW**: Simple, quick changes
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Moderate complexity
- 🟠 **HIGH**: Complex refactoring
- 🔴 **VERY_HIGH**: Major rewrites

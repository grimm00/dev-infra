## Individual Comments

## Overall Comments

- The new spike/review/commit/handoff command docs are duplicated across dev-infra and both template types with near-identical content; consider extracting shared sections or using a single source + template-sync to reduce drift and future maintenance overhead.
- Several commands now describe non-trivial workflows with inline shell snippets (e.g., docs-only detection in /task-phase, PR status logic in /fix-implement); it may be more maintainable to reference the concrete helper scripts/commands these map to so the documentation stays aligned when the underlying logic evolves.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Overall-#1 (template duplication) | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Already addressed -- `template-sync-manifest.txt` (23 commands) syncs all shared files between templates. Duplication is by design with automated drift detection in CI. No action needed. |
| Overall-#2 (inline shell snippets) | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | Valid long-term observation. Commands are AI instruction docs (markdown), not executable scripts. Inline snippets are illustrative, not executable. Extracting to helper scripts would add indirection without clear benefit at current scale. Defer. |

### Priority Levels
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Security, stability, or core functionality issues
- 🟠 **HIGH**: Bug risks or significant maintainability issues
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Code quality and maintainability improvements
- 🟢 **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Impact Levels
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Affects core functionality
- 🟠 **HIGH**: User-facing or significant changes
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Developer experience improvements
- 🟢 **LOW**: Minor improvements

### Effort Levels
- 🟢 **LOW**: Simple, quick changes
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Moderate complexity
- 🟠 **HIGH**: Complex refactoring
- 🔴 **VERY_HIGH**: Major rewrites

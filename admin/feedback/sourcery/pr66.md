## Individual Comments

### Comment #1

**Location**: `scripts/doc-gen/templates/research/research-topic.md.tmpl:31`

**Type**: suggestion

**Description**: Marking Goal 1 as `[x]` makes every new doc look like it already has progress, which can skew status views (e.g., dashboards, GitHub checklists). Prefer starting all goals as `[ ]` so completion always reflects an intentional update.

<b>Code Context</b>

<pre><code>
+&lt;!-- REQUIRED: At least 3 goals --&gt;

-&lt;!-- AI: List goals --&gt;
+- [x] Goal 1: &lt;!-- AI: First goal statement --&gt;
+- [ ] Goal 2: &lt;!-- AI: Second goal statement --&gt;
+- [ ] Goal 3: &lt;!-- AI: Third goal statement --&gt;
</code></pre>

<b>Issue</b>

**suggestion:** Pre-checking Goal 1 may misleadingly imply completed work in new documents.

<pre><code>
- [ ] Goal 1: &lt;!-- AI: First goal statement --&gt;

## Overall Comments

- The docs-only vs code-phase detection rules (file extensions, special cases, mixed changes, etc.) are now embedded in multiple command docs (e.g., `/task-phase`, `/task-release`, `/task-improvement`); consider centralizing these criteria in a single reference and linking to it from commands to keep the rules consistent as they evolve.
- Several commands now describe the same three-path temp directory conventions (dev-infra `admin/tmp/**`, template `tmp/**`, lightweight `tests/tmp/**`); it may be easier to maintain if these path patterns are documented once in a shared convention doc and commands link to that instead of repeating the full description.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

Use this template to assess each comment:

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| #1 (pre-checked Goal 1) | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Valid catch. Template has `[x]` on Goal 1 as a structural example showing format, but it could mislead. Fix in next release or as quick fix. |
| Overall-#1 (centralize detection rules) | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | Good long-term suggestion. Workflow simplification exploration (v0.10.0+) will likely address this naturally. Defer. |
| Overall-#2 (centralize temp path conventions) | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | Same pattern as Overall-#1. Shared convention doc would reduce duplication. Defer to workflow simplification. |

### Priority Levels
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Security, stability, or core functionality issues
- 🟠 **HIGH**: Bug risks or significant maintainability issues
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Code quality and maintainability improvements
- 🟢 **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Impact Levels
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Affects core functionality
- 🟠 **HIGH**: User-facing or significant changes
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Developer experience improvements
- 🟢 **LOW**: Minor improvements

### Effort Levels
- 🟢 **LOW**: Simple, quick changes
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Moderate complexity
- 🟠 **HIGH**: Complex refactoring
- 🔴 **VERY_HIGH**: Major rewrites

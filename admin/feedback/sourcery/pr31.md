## Overall Comments

- The fix plan document still lists `Status: 🔴 Not Started` and several unchecked Definition of Done items that this PR actually implements; consider updating these status fields to reflect the current state before merging to avoid confusion for future readers.
- The fix plan hard-codes specific test counts (e.g., `122 tests`, `5 tests`) in multiple places; consider rephrasing these more generically or centralizing them in one location to reduce the risk of the document becoming stale as the test suite evolves.

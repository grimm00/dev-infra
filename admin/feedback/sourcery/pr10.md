## Overall Comments

- Confirm that any CLI tools or scripts, like new-project.sh, have been updated to reference “Standard Project” instead of the old “Regular Project” prompts.
- Make sure the filesystem rename of templates/regular-project to templates/standard-project is committed and all CI/CD or tooling references are updated accordingly.
- Verify that all markdown links pointing to the old admin/ directories correctly resolve to the new docs/maintainers/ paths to avoid broken links.

## Overall Comments

- Consider only enabling `fetch-depth: 0` for the jobs that actually perform git branch operations (e.g., `quick-checks` and `full-tests-*`) to avoid unnecessarily slowing down the `build-image` job if it doesn’t rely on full history.
- In the planning file, the status is marked as ✅ Complete while CI validation steps are still unchecked; you may want to keep the status as in-progress until the workflow has run successfully in CI to avoid confusion for future readers.

## Overall Comments

- There are several nested fenced code blocks using combinations of ```markdown, ````markdown and closing fences (especially around the Phase 3 planning file and the TDD examples); it would be worth rendering the docs locally to ensure all blocks are closed correctly and not accidentally swallowing surrounding content.
- The troubleshooting section suggests using a `--force` flag to re-expand an already-expanded phase, but `--force` is not described in the options/flag-handling sections; either document this flag or adjust the troubleshooting guidance to match the actual interface.
- The examples for invoking `/task-phase` are a bit inconsistent (e.g., `/task-phase [N] 1` vs `/task-phase phase-1`); consider standardizing these examples so users have a single clear pattern to follow.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| #1 Nested code blocks | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | May explain IDE rendering issues - investigate |
| #2 Undocumented --force flag | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Deferred - add flag to options or update troubleshooting |
| #3 /task-phase example inconsistency | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Deferred - cosmetic consistency improvement |

## Individual Comments

## Overall Comments

- Consider consolidating the Installation and Quick Start sections in README to avoid duplication and streamline onboarding.
- The integration guide is very large—splitting it into focused sub-documents or sections could improve readability and maintainability.
- Evaluate automating the {{CURRENT_DATE}} placeholder in templates to avoid manual updates and ensure consistency.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

Use this template to assess each comment:

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| #1 | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | Valid concern - some duplication between Installation and Quick Start |
| #2 | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 MEDIUM | INTEGRATION.md is 600+ lines - could be more maintainable |
| #3 | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | Nice to have, prevents stale dates - defer to v0.1.1 |

## Review Decisions

### Medium Priority Items (Addressing in v0.1.0)
- **Comment #1**: Consolidate README sections - Will merge Installation into Quick Start to reduce duplication
- **Comment #2**: Split integration guide - Will create docs/integration/ directory with focused sub-documents

### Low Priority Items (Deferred to v0.1.1)
- **Comment #3**: Automate {{CURRENT_DATE}} placeholder - Enhancement for future release, not blocking v0.1.0

### Rationale
- Medium priority items improve user experience and maintainability
- Low priority item is nice-to-have but not essential for initial release
- All feedback is valid and will be addressed appropriately

## Individual Comments

## Overall Comments

- The new drift-detection tests use very loose output assertions (e.g., `[[ "$output" == *"missing"* ]] || [[ "$output" == *"DRIFT"* ]] || [[ "$output" == *"test-file.txt"* ]]`); consider tightening these to a single expected phrase or regex per case to avoid false positives from unrelated messages.
- The non-interactive mode test for `new-project` depends on `timeout` being available and uses a hard-coded 10s limit; it may be more robust to either skip this test when `timeout` is missing or to centralize/shorten the timeout to keep the suite fast while still catching hangs.

## Priority Matrix Assessment

| Comment | Priority | Impact | Effort | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Overall #1 | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | Tighten output assertions - quick win if desired |
| Overall #2 | 🟢 LOW | 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | Improve timeout handling - quick win if desired |

**Summary:**
- **CRITICAL/HIGH:** 0 (no blockers)
- **MEDIUM:** 0
- **LOW:** 2 (minor improvements - can fix now or defer)

**Action:** PR is ready to merge. Both comments are quick wins if desired but not blocking.

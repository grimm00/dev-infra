## Overall Comments

- Extract the repeated BATS setup and test execution steps into a reusable action or YAML anchor to reduce duplication across workflows.

- Verify that the concurrency group definitions correctly scope cancellations as intended to avoid inadvertently cancelling unrelated workflow runs.

### Bug: Project Name Mismatch: Displayed vs. Actual

When a project name with spaces is sanitized to use dashes, the project summary displays the original name with spaces while the actual project is created with the sanitized name. The project_name variable retains the user's original input, but validate_project_name returns a path containing the sanitized name. This creates a confusing mismatch where the summary shows "Name: my project" but "Location: /path/to/my-project", and the project is actually created as "my-project".

### Bug: Missing dependency breaks GitHub authentication.

The verify_github_auth function uses the external jq command to parse JSON output without checking if it's installed. Line 362 pipes user_info through jq -r '.login // "unknown"', which will fail if jq is not available on the system. The function should either check for jq availability or use gh's built-in --jq flag directly

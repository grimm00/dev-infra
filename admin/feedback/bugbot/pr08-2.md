### Bug: Test Fails on Outdated Template Structure

The test checks for the outdated path admin/planning but both the production code and test helper now output docs/maintainers/planning. This test will fail because it validates against the old template structure instead of the new one introduced by the template restructure.

### Bug: Double footer: Document ends twice.

The entire footer section including "How to Use This Document", "Related Documentation", "Last Updated", "PR #7 Additions", and "PR #8 Additions" is duplicated. Lines 338-391 repeat content that already appears at lines 263-336, creating a confusing duplicate of the document's ending.

## Bug: Document Content: Double Vision

The entire document content is duplicated. Lines 109-213 repeat the exact same content from lines 1-107, including the title, date, purpose, structure issues, proposed structure, benefits, test categorization, migration steps, and running tests sections.

### Bug: Broken Paths Hinder User First Steps

The show_next_steps function references admin/planning/README.md and admin/planning/features/, but Phase 1 restructured templates to use docs/maintainers/planning/ instead. Generated projects will display incorrect paths that don't exist, breaking the user's first steps after project creation.

### Bug: Outdated Path Breaks Test Validation

The test helper's show_next_steps function references admin/planning/README.md, but templates now use docs/maintainers/planning/README.md. This causes tests to validate incorrect output that doesn't match the actual template structure.

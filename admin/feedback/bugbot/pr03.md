Bug: Internal Content Leaks to Public Distribution

The workflow merges admin/CHANGELOG.md into the root CHANGELOG.md before creating the distribution package, which contradicts the goal of excluding internal content. If admin/CHANGELOG.md exists, the modified CHANGELOG.md with "Admin/Internal Changes" section will be included in the user-facing distribution, exposing internal planning information that should remain excluded.

Bug: Release Version Extraction: Misaligned References.

The version extraction uses GITHUB_REF which in a release: published event points to the default branch (like refs/heads/main), not the tag. The regex patterns expect refs/tags/... format and will fail with an error. The workflow should extract the version from github.event.release.tag_name instead, which contains the actual tag name for release events.

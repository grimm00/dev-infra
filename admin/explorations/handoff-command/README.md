## 🎯 Overview

Explore creating a `/handoff` command that enables structured context transfer between AI chat sessions. As chat sessions continue, performance tends to degrade due to context accumulation. This command would provide a clean way for one session to "hand off" and another to "pick up".

**Origin:** Inspired by successful manual handoff document used in proj-cli (`tmp/handoff-2026-01-06.md`).

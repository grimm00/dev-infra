## 📋 Research Topics

This document lists research topics and questions that need investigation for the project model definition.

---

### Research Topic 1: Classification Enum Alignment

**Question:** Should work-prod migrate from current classification values to research-recommended values?

**Why:** Current enum (`primary`, `secondary`, `archive`, `maintenance`) doesn't align with the taxonomy designed in work-prod research (`Work`, `Personal`, `Learning`, `Inactive`).

**Priority:** High (affects Tier 2)

**Status:** ✅ Complete - See [research-classification-enum.md](../../research/project-model-definition/research-classification-enum.md)

**Key Finding:** The two enums represent **different concepts** - current is priority/importance, research is project type. Recommendation: Add new `project_type` field, keep existing `classification`.

**Sub-questions:**

- Is there existing data using current enum values?
- What's the migration path?
- Do current values map cleanly to new values?
- Impact on proj-cli commands?

**Options:**

1. Keep current values (no change)
2. Migrate to research values (breaking change)
3. Add new values, deprecate old ones (gradual migration)

### Research Topic 2: Organization Implementation

**Question:** Should `organization` remain a string field or migrate to FK?

**Why:** String field is simpler but lacks referential integrity. FK enables organization metadata (color, display name, type).

**Priority:** Medium (affects Tier 2)

**Status:** 🔴 Not Started

**Sub-questions:**

- Does work-prod have an organizations table?
- What organization metadata is needed?
- Is referential integrity important for this use case?
- Migration complexity?

**Options:**

1. Keep string (simple, works now)
2. Add FK, keep string for backward compatibility
3. Migrate to FK only (breaking change)

### Research Topic 3: Tier 1 API Contract

**Question:** What exact API contract does proj-cli need from work-prod for Tier 1?

**Why:** proj-cli needs to know exactly what endpoints and fields are available.

**Priority:** High (enables Tier 1 implementation)

**Status:** ✅ Complete - See [research-tier-1-api-contract.md](../../research/project-model-definition/research-tier-1-api-contract.md)

**Key Finding:** API is **complete and ready**. OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec (691 lines) is authoritative. proj-cli client fully compatible. 7 Tier 1 fields ready to use.

**Sub-questions:**

- What endpoints exist in work-prod?
- What fields are required vs optional on create?
- What fields are returned on list/get?
- Error response format?

**Deliverable:** API contract document for proj-cli team

### Research Topic 4: Learning Taxonomy Implementation

**Question:** How should learning sub-classification be implemented?

**Why:** 17 of 59 projects are Learning type - needs sub-classification for meaningful metrics.

**Priority:** High (Tier 3, but marked MVP-critical)

**Status:** 🔴 Not Started

**Sub-questions:**

- Are the three learning types sufficient? (work_related, personal_dev, hybrid)
- Should learning_type be required for Learning classification?
- How to handle existing Learning projects without sub-classification?
- UI implications?

**Reference:** [work-prod Learning Project Taxonomy](../../../../work-prod/docs/maintainers/research/data-models/learning-project-taxonomy.md) (429 lines of detailed research)

### Research Topic 5: Skills Matrix Integration

**Question:** How should projects connect to the skills matrix?

**Why:** Skills matrix is a key feature - projects need to link to skills.

**Priority:** Medium (Tier 4)

**Status:** 🔴 Not Started

**Sub-questions:**

- JSON `tech_stack` vs junction table vs both?
- How to populate skills from inventory scan?
- Proficiency tracking per project - is it needed?
- How to sync with GitHub language detection?

**Reference:** [work-prod Projects Data Model](../../../../work-prod/docs/maintainers/research/data-models/projects-data-model.md) (Section: Projects-Skills Junction Table)

---

### Research Topic 6: Analysis Field Requirements

**Question:** What fields does the analysis service need?

**Why:** Analysis service (work-prod) needs specific fields to calculate metrics.

**Priority:** Low (Tier 5)

**Status:** 🔴 Not Started

**Sub-questions:**

- What analysis capabilities are planned?
- What fields feed those capabilities?
- Can analysis be computed vs stored?
- How to keep analysis fields up to date?

**Reference:** [Work-Prod Analysis Service Exploration](../work-prod-analysis-service/README.md)

## 📊 Priority Matrix

| Topic | Priority | Tier | Status |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
| Tier 1 API Contract | High | 1 | ✅ Complete |
| Classification Enum | High | 2 | ✅ Complete |
| Learning Taxonomy | High | 3 | 🔴 Not Started |
| Organization Implementation | Medium | 2 | 🔴 Not Started |
| Skills Matrix Integration | Medium | 4 | 🔴 Not Started |
| Analysis Field Requirements | Low | 5 | 🔴 Not Started |

**Recommended Research Order:**

1. ✅ Tier 1 API Contract (enables proj-cli work immediately)
2. ✅ Classification Enum (foundational decision)
3. Learning Taxonomy (MVP-critical per work-prod)
4. Organization Implementation (can defer)
5. Skills Matrix Integration (depends on Skills feature)
6. Analysis Field Requirements (depends on Analysis service)

## 🎯 Research Workflow

1. ✅ Used `/research project-model-definition --conduct` to conduct research
2. ✅ Research documents created in `admin/research/project-model-definition/`
3. 🟠 2/6 topics complete
4. After research complete, use `/decision project-model-definition --from-research` to make decisions

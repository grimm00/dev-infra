## 🎯 Overview

This exploration defines what a "project" is across the four-arm architecture (dev-infra, dev-toolkit, proj-cli, work-prod) using a tiered approach:

| Tier | Scope | Timeline |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | Core Registry (MVP) | Immediate |
| **Tier 2** | Classification & Organization | Near-term |
| **Tier 3** | Learning Sub-Classification | Near-term |
| **Tier 4** | Skills Matrix Integration | Medium-term |
| **Tier 5** | Analysis & Metrics | Longer-term |

**Key Insight:** 7 fields are already implemented in work-prod and ready for Tier 1.

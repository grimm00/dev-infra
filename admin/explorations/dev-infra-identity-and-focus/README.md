## 🎯 Overview

Dev-infra has grown organically and is now serving multiple purposes that create complexity and confusion:

1. **Laboratory** - Where we experiment with workflow ideas
2. **Factory** - Where we produce templates for other projects
3. **Reference Implementation** - Using what we build to build it

This exploration examines whether dev-infra should focus primarily on being a **template factory** rather than a workflow experimentation platform.

## 📊 Context

**Trigger:** During v1.4.0 post-release reflection, realized:
- Every improvement to dev-infra's workflow could become a template feature
- But not every experiment should go into templates
- There's confusion about what belongs in `features/` vs `ci/` vs internal tooling
- Commands are guides for AI agents, not hard-coded functionality - different maintenance model
- High overhead for tracking improvements that may not deliver template value

**Key Insight:** "I need to use dev-infra as a templatizer more so than handling so many development ideas at once"

**Decisions:** [admin/decisions/dev-infra-identity-and-focus/](../../decisions/dev-infra-identity-and-focus/)  
**Next Step:** Review and approve ADRs, then use `/transition-plan` to update v1.5.0 scope

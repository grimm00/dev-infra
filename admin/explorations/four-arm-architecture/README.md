## 🎯 Overview

This exploration maps the relationship between four interconnected projects that form a complete developer infrastructure ecosystem:

| Project | Language | Primary Purpose |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **dev-infra** | N/A | Templates, patterns, Cursor AI commands |
| **dev-toolkit** | Bash | Developer CLI utilities (`dt-*` commands) |
| **proj-cli** | Python | Project management (`proj` commands) |
| **work-prod** | Python/Flask | Data API backend |

**Key Insight:** These four projects each have distinct responsibilities, but work together to provide a complete development experience.

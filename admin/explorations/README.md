## 🎯 Overview

This directory contains active explorations, proof of concepts, and abstract ideas being explored before research and decision phases.

**Workflow:**
1. `/explore [topic]` - Start exploration
2. `/research [topic] --from-explore [topic]` - Conduct research
3. `/decision [topic] --from-research` - Make decisions
4. `/transition-plan --from-adr` - Transition to planning

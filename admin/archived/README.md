### [experimental-template-v0.6.0/](experimental-template-v0.6.0/)

The experimental template feature was created in v0.6.0 and removed in v0.7.0 as part of the command simplification effort.

**Reason for archival:** ADR-001 (Commands as Guides) determined that the graduation process was over-engineering. All templates now receive all commands.

**Contains:**
- Feature planning documents
- Research documents
- Decision records
- Exploration notes

### [graduation-process/](graduation-process/)

Documentation for the graduation process that was used to promote commands from "experimental" to "stable".

**Reason for archival:** Superseded by ADR-001 (Commands as Guides) in v0.7.0. Commands are now treated as AI guides, not CLI tools requiring maturity gates.

**Contains:**
- ADR-004: Graduation Process (superseded)
- Graduation checklist template
- Research on graduation criteria

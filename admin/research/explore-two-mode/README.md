## 🎯 Research Overview

This research supports enhancing the `/explore` command with three interconnected improvements:

1. **Two-Mode Pattern** - Setup + Conduct modes (like `/research` and `/transition-plan`)
2. **Explicit Input Sources** - Accept `start.txt`, reflections, and other sources
3. **Topic Unification** - Generalize `--topic [name] --type` pattern across commands

Additionally:
4. **Command Improvement Organization** - Consolidate `*-two-mode` features

**Research Topics:** 6 topics (3 High, 3 Medium priority)  
**Status:** 🔴 Research

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Use `/research explore-two-mode --conduct --topic-num 1` to research Command Improvement Organization
2. Continue with topics 2-6
3. Review requirements in `requirements.md`
4. Use `/decision explore-two-mode --from-research` to make decisions

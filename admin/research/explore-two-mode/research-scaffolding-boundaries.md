## 🎯 Research Question

What content boundaries should `/explore` use for Setup vs Conduct mode?

**Context:** Need consistent, predictable output sizes like transition-plan-two-mode achieved (~60-80 lines setup, ~200-300 conduct). The `/explore` command should follow this pattern.

---

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Analyze transition-plan-two-mode scaffolding boundaries (ADR-002)
- [ ] Goal 2: Define what sections go in scaffolding vs detailed exploration
- [ ] Goal 3: Determine when `research-topics.md` should be created (Setup or Conduct)
- [ ] Goal 4: Evaluate how much context Setup mode should include

**Sources:**
- [ ] Transition-plan-two-mode ADR-002 (Scaffolding Content Boundaries)
- [ ] Current `/explore` command output analysis
- [ ] `/research` command scaffolding analysis
- [ ] Web search: Best practices for scaffolding vs content separation

**Sub-questions to investigate:**
- What sections go in scaffolding vs detailed exploration?
- Should research-topics.md be created in Setup or Conduct mode?
- How much context should Setup mode include?
- Should Setup mode prompt for key questions or leave them for Conduct?

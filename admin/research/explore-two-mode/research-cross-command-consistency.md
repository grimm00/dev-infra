## 🎯 Research Question

What UX patterns should be consistent across all two-mode commands?

**Context:** `/research`, `/transition-plan`, and `/explore` should feel consistent to users. Need to define shared patterns for flags, status indicators, and incremental progress.

---

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Compare flag patterns across two-mode commands (`--conduct` vs `--expand`)
- [ ] Goal 2: Standardize status indicators (`🔴 Scaffolding` → `✅ Expanded`)
- [ ] Goal 3: Define incremental progress patterns (`--topic-num` vs `--phase`)
- [ ] Goal 4: Evaluate need for shared "two-mode pattern" documentation page

---

## 📚 Research Methodology

**Sources:**
- [ ] `/research` command two-mode implementation
- [ ] `/transition-plan` command two-mode implementation (ADR-001)
- [ ] Current `/explore` command implementation
- [ ] Web search: UX consistency patterns for CLI tools

**Sub-questions to investigate:**
- Should all use `--conduct` or should `/explore` use `--expand`?
- Should status indicators be identical (`🔴 Scaffolding` → `✅ Expanded`)?
- How should incremental progress work (`--topic-num` vs `--phase`)?
- Should there be a shared "two-mode pattern" documentation page?

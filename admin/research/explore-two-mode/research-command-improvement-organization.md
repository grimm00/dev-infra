## 🎯 Research Question

Should command improvement features be consolidated, and what directory structure is appropriate?

**Context:** Currently have 4 separate `*-two-mode` features:
- `transition-plan-two-mode` (✅ Complete)
- `explore-two-mode` (🟡 Planned)
- `decision-two-mode` (🟡 Planned)
- `reflect-two-mode` (🔴 Needs Evaluation)

Consolidation could reduce duplication and improve discoverability.

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Determine if command improvements are "features" or "internal tooling"
- [ ] Goal 2: Evaluate directory structure options (`features/`, `ci/`, `commands/improvements/`)
- [ ] Goal 3: Assess impact on completed transition-plan-two-mode
- [ ] Goal 4: Recommend approach for existing scattered feature directories

## 📚 Research Methodology

**Sources:**
- [ ] Current feature directory structure analysis
- [ ] CI directory structure analysis
- [ ] Transition-plan-two-mode implementation review
- [ ] Web search: Best practices for organizing internal tooling vs features

**Sub-questions to investigate:**
- Are command improvements "features" or "internal tooling"?
- Would a `commands/improvements/` directory be better than `features/`?
- How does consolidation affect the transition-plan-two-mode (already complete)?
- What should happen to existing scattered feature directories?

## 🎯 Research Question

What explicit input sources should `/explore` accept?

**Context:** Unlike `/research --from-explore`, the `/explore` command has no `--from-*` options. Adding input sources would improve workflow by bootstrapping explorations from existing context.

---

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Analyze `start.txt` content and structure for exploration seeding
- [ ] Goal 2: Identify other documents that could seed explorations (reflections, feature plans, ADRs)
- [ ] Goal 3: Define how command extracts exploration context from each source type
- [ ] Goal 4: Determine flag naming (`--from-start`, `--from-project-init`, etc.)

---

## 📚 Research Methodology

**Sources:**
- [ ] `start.txt` template analysis (dev-infra and templates)
- [ ] Reflection document structure analysis
- [ ] Feature plan structure analysis
- [ ] ADR document structure analysis
- [ ] Web search: Best practices for context-driven exploration workflows

**Sub-questions to investigate:**
- What content does `start.txt` provide that's useful for exploration?
- What other documents could seed explorations (reflections, feature plans, ADRs)?
- How should the command extract exploration context from each source type?
- Should there be a `--from-start` or `--from-project-init` flag?

## 📋 Research Overview

This research investigates how four interconnected projects should work together as a unified developer infrastructure ecosystem while maintaining standalone usability.

**Research Topics:** 6 topics  
**Research Documents:** 6 documents  
**Status:** 🔴 Research (0/6 complete)

## 🏗️ Architecture Context

| Project | Language | Primary Purpose |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **dev-infra** | N/A | Templates, patterns, Cursor AI commands, shared contracts |
| **dev-toolkit** | Bash | Developer CLI utilities (`dt-*` commands) |
| **proj-cli** | Python | Project management (`proj` commands) |
| **work-prod** | Python/Flask | Data API backend |

**Key Design Principle:** Each project can stand alone for external users, but shared business logic is coordinated through dev-infra.

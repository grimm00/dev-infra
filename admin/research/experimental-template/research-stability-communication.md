## 🎯 Research Question

How do we clearly communicate stability levels to users so they understand what they're getting with experimental commands?

**Users need to understand:**
- Which commands are stable vs experimental
- What "experimental" means in practice
- Expected update/breaking change frequency
- How to provide feedback

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Research how other projects handle beta/experimental features
- [ ] Goal 2: Identify what warnings/disclaimers are needed
- [ ] Goal 3: Determine if experimental commands need visual indicators
- [ ] Goal 4: Define clear stability level definitions

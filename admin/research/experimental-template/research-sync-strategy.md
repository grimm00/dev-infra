## 🎯 Research Question

How do we keep the experimental template in sync with the standard template to prevent drift and minimize maintenance burden?

**The problem:**
- Standard template evolves over time
- Experimental template must include standard changes PLUS experimental features
- Manual sync is error-prone and time-consuming

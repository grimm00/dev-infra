## 🎯 Research Question

Which implementation approach is best for delivering experimental commands to users?

**Options to evaluate:**
1. **Separate Template:** `experimental-project/` alongside `standard-project/`
2. **Template Flag:** `./new-project.sh --experimental`
3. **Addon System:** `./add-experimental-commands.sh` post-generation

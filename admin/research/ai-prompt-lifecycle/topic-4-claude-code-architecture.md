## 🎯 Research Question

Claude Code is built by Anthropic (the model creator). Their instruction patterns likely reflect deep understanding of what works for Claude models. How does CLAUDE.md work? What are skills? How do they compare to our `.cursor/rules/` and `.cursor/commands/` approach? Is there a workflow orchestration layer, or is it purely rules-based?

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Document CLAUDE.md mechanics (location, loading, scoping, format)
- [ ] Goal 2: Understand the "skills" concept (what they are, how they're loaded, demand vs. auto)
- [ ] Goal 3: Compare CLAUDE.md to .cursor/rules/ (structural and mechanical differences)
- [ ] Goal 4: Determine if Claude Code has a workflow orchestration equivalent to our commands
- [ ] Goal 5: Review real-world CLAUDE.md files for content patterns and best practices

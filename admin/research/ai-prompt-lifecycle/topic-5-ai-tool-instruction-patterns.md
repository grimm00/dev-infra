## 🎯 Research Question

The AI coding tool landscape is evolving rapidly. Are there emerging standards for how developers configure AI coding agents with project-specific instructions? How do other tools handle the same problems our commands address (workflow guidance, output formatting, behavioral rules)?

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Survey instruction/configuration patterns across major AI coding tools
- [ ] Goal 2: Identify convergence toward standard formats (if any)
- [ ] Goal 3: Compare prompt-defined vs. code-defined workflow approaches
- [ ] Goal 4: Identify patterns worth adopting or learning from
- [ ] Goal 5: Assess whether dev-infra's command approach is novel, standard, or divergent

## 🎯 Research Overview

This research evaluates the current template structure against:
- **Internal Best Practices:** Hub-and-spoke documentation patterns from `docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md`
- **External Industry Standards:** Documentation structure best practices, maintainer vs user doc separation
- **Current State:** Actual structure snapshots and usage patterns

### Key Research Questions

1. How should maintainer documentation be organized in templates?
2. Should templates use `admin/` or `docs/maintainers/` for maintainer docs?
3. What is the optimal naming for project templates?
4. How can we best combine internal best practices with external conventions?

---

## 📊 Research Findings Summary

### Current Issues Identified

1. **Mixed Audience:** `admin/` name doesn't clearly indicate maintainer/planning docs
2. **Naming Ambiguity:** "regular-project" is vague; "standard-project" is clearer
3. **Inconsistent Signals:** Templates mix maintainer and user-facing content
4. **Template Clarity:** Users may not understand `admin/` is for their own project planning

### Proposed Solution

**Hybrid Approach:** Combine internal hub-and-spoke patterns with external conventions

- **Templates:** Use `docs/maintainers/` instead of `admin/` for maintainer docs
- **Main Repo:** Keep `admin/` for now (established, working well)
- **Naming:** Rename `regular-project` → `standard-project`
- **Structure:** Maintain hub-and-spoke pattern within maintainer docs

### Key Benefits

- ✅ Clear audience separation (users vs maintainers)
- ✅ Industry-standard location (`docs/` universally recognized)
- ✅ Maintains internal hub-and-spoke best practices
- ✅ Better naming and clearer purpose

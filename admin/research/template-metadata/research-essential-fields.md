## 🎯 Research Question

What fields/information should the metadata file contain? What's essential for sync to work vs nice-to-have for enhanced features?

---

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Identify minimum fields needed for sync functionality
- [ ] Goal 2: Identify fields that would enable enhanced features
- [ ] Goal 3: Review what similar tools include in their metadata
- [ ] Goal 4: Categorize fields by priority (essential, recommended, optional)

## 📚 Research Methodology

**Approach:** Analyze sync requirements and research similar tools.

**Note:** Web search is **allowed and encouraged** for research.

**Candidate Fields to Evaluate:**
- `template` - Which template was used (standard-project, learning-project)
- `version` - Dev-infra version at generation time
- `created` - When project was generated
- `last_sync` - When project was last synced
- `sync.always` - Files that always sync
- `sync.ask` - Files that require confirmation
- `sync.never` - Files that never sync
- `customizations` - User customizations to track

**Sources:**
- [ ] Web search: Project scaffolding metadata patterns
- [ ] Case studies: Yeoman, create-react-app, Angular CLI, etc.
- [ ] Internal analysis: What we need for each scenario

## 🎯 Research Question

How should dev-infra handle projects that were generated before the metadata system existed? How do we migrate existing projects to include metadata?

---

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Identify existing dev-infra projects that would need migration
- [ ] Goal 2: Research how other tools handle retroactive metadata addition
- [ ] Goal 3: Design migration workflow (manual vs automated)
- [ ] Goal 4: Assess risks and edge cases

## 📚 Research Methodology

**Approach:** Analyze existing projects and research migration patterns.

**Note:** Web search is **allowed and encouraged** for research.

**Known Projects to Consider:**
- work-prod (generated before metadata)
- proj-cli (existing project, potential adoption)
- Future projects generated with metadata

**Sources:**
- [ ] Web search: Config file migration patterns
- [ ] Case studies: How tools add config to existing projects
- [ ] Internal analysis: Existing project structures

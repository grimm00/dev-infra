## 💭 Assumptions

### A-1: Single User Context

**Description:** Dev-infra currently has a single user (creator). Metadata system can be simpler and more opinionated.

**Source:** [Dev-Infra Identity Exploration v2](../../explorations/dev-infra-identity-and-focus/exploration.md)

---

### A-2: Bash Script Ecosystem

**Description:** Dev-infra uses bash scripts for tooling. Metadata format should be easily parseable in bash.

**Source:** Current dev-infra patterns

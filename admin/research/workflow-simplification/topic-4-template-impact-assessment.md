## 🎯 Research Goal

**Key Question:** How would workflow simplification affect the standard-project and learning-project templates, and is it a breaking change for existing projects?

**Context:** Templates are the product. Changes to the planning structure directly affect every project generated from these templates. The learning-project template has additional complexity (stage-based progression) that may interact differently with a flat work breakdown.

## 🔍 Methodology

**Suggested Approach (from research-topics):**

- [ ] Map current template planning structure (files, commands, references)
- [ ] Identify which files would be removed, renamed, or restructured
- [ ] Assess learning-project specific concerns (stages vs. flat tasks)
- [ ] Define "breaking change" criteria: what would require existing projects to change?
- [ ] Propose migration guidance or backward compatibility strategy

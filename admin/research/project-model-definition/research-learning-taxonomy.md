## 🎯 Research Question

How should learning sub-classification be implemented?

**Context:** 17 of 59 projects (29%) are Learning type. Without sub-classification, the system cannot:
- Distinguish work-required learning from personal hobbies
- Accurately track work vs personal time allocation
- Provide meaningful metrics

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Review existing work-prod learning taxonomy research
- [ ] Goal 2: Validate three learning types are sufficient
- [ ] Goal 3: Determine implementation approach
- [ ] Goal 4: Plan migration for existing data

---

## 📚 Research Methodology

**Approach:** Review existing research, validate with user needs.

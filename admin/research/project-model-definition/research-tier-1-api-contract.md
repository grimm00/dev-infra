## 🎯 Research Question

What exact API contract does proj-cli need from work-prod for Tier 1?

This research will define the minimum viable API contract that allows proj-cli to:
- Create project records
- List and retrieve projects
- Update project information
- Push inventory data to the registry

---

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Document existing work-prod API endpoints
- [ ] Goal 2: Identify required vs optional fields for each operation
- [ ] Goal 3: Define error response format
- [ ] Goal 4: Create API contract document for proj-cli

---

## 📚 Research Methodology

**Approach:** Audit existing work-prod API implementation and document contract.

**Sources:**
- [ ] work-prod OpenAPI specification (`backend/openapi.yaml`)
- [ ] work-prod API routes (`backend/app/api/`)
- [ ] work-prod project model (`backend/app/models/project.py`)
- [ ] proj-cli API client (`src/proj/api_client.py`)

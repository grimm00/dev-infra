## 🎯 Research Question

What document types need templates and what structure should each have? This is foundational - all other research topics depend on knowing what docs exist and what structure they need.

---

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [x] Goal 1: Inventory all doc types across workflows (explore, research, decision, handoff, task-phase, fix)
- [x] Goal 2: Identify common patterns (status headers, quick links, hub-and-spoke)
- [x] Goal 3: Determine required vs optional sections for each doc type
- [x] Goal 4: Document which docs are generated by commands vs manually created

---

## 📚 Research Methodology

**Sources:**
- [x] Source 1: Audit `admin/explorations/` directory structure and doc patterns
- [x] Source 2: Audit `admin/research/` directory structure and doc patterns
- [x] Source 3: Audit `admin/decisions/` directory structure and doc patterns

## 📊 Findings

### Finding 1: Document Types by Workflow

**Comprehensive inventory of all doc types across the six main workflows:**

| Workflow | Command | Doc Types | Location |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Exploration | `/explore` | README.md, exploration.md, research-topics.md | `admin/explorations/[topic]/` |
| Research | `/research` | README.md, research-[topic].md, research-summary.md, requirements.md | `admin/research/[topic]/` |
| Decision | `/decision` | README.md, adr-NNN-[name].md, decisions-summary.md, transition-plan.md | `admin/decisions/[topic]/` |
| Feature Planning | `/transition-plan`, `/task-phase` | README.md, feature-plan.md, transition-plan.md, phase-N.md, status-and-next-steps.md | `admin/planning/features/[feature]/` |
| Fix | `/fix-plan`, `/fix-implement` | fix-review-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md, deferred-tasks.md, fix-batch docs | `admin/planning/fix/` |
| Handoff | `/handoff` (proposed) | handoff.md | `tmp/` (untracked) |

**Source:** Direct audit of `admin/explorations/`, `admin/research/`, `admin/decisions/`, `admin/planning/`

**Relevance:** This inventory identifies 17 distinct doc types that need templates for consistent generation.

### Finding 2: Common Structural Patterns

**Five common patterns appear across all doc types:**

#### Pattern 1: Status Header Block
```markdown
**Status:** [🔴 Not Started | 🟠 In Progress | ✅ Complete]
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
```
**Used in:** All docs (required)

#### Pattern 2: Quick Links Section
```markdown
## 📋 Quick Links

- **[Document 1](doc1.md)** - Description ⭐ **NEW**
- **[Document 2](doc2.md)** - Description
```
**Used in:** Hub docs (README.md, feature hubs)

#### Pattern 3: Status Tables
```markdown
| Topic | Priority | Status | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| Item 1 | 🔴 High | 🔴 Not Started | - |
| Item 2 | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Complete | Key finding |
```
**Used in:** Research hubs, decision hubs, feature hubs

#### Pattern 4: Next Steps Section
```markdown
## 🚀 Next Steps

1. [First action with specific command]
2. [Second action]
```
**Used in:** All docs (required at end)

#### Pattern 5: Related Links Section
```markdown
## 🔗 Related

- **[Related Item](../path/to/item/)** - Description
```
**Used in:** Exploration, research, decision docs

**Source:** Analysis of `admin/explorations/template-doc-infrastructure/`, `admin/research/dev-infra-identity-and-focus/`, `admin/decisions/dev-infra-identity-and-focus/`

**Relevance:** These patterns should be standardized across all templates for consistency.

---

### Finding 3: Hub-and-Spoke Documentation Pattern

**Every workflow uses hub-and-spoke organization:**

```
[workflow]/[topic]/
├── README.md           ← Hub (links to all spokes)
├── [primary-doc].md    ← Main content spoke
├── [secondary-doc].md  ← Supporting spoke
└── [tertiary-doc].md   ← Additional spoke
```

**Examples by workflow:**

| Workflow | Hub | Primary Spoke | Supporting Spokes |
|----------|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| Exploration | README.md | exploration.md | research-topics.md |
| Research | README.md | research-summary.md | research-[topic].md, requirements.md |
| Decision | README.md | decisions-summary.md | adr-NNN-[name].md, transition-plan.md |
| Feature | README.md | feature-plan.md | phase-N.md, status-and-next-steps.md |

**Source:** Pattern analysis across all workflow directories

**Relevance:** Templates should reinforce this hub-and-spoke pattern with consistent cross-linking.

---

### Finding 4: Line Count Guidelines (from /explore Two-Mode Pattern)

**The `/explore` command already defines target line counts:**

| Document | Setup Mode | Conduct Mode |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| README.md (hub) | ~20 lines | ~20 lines |
| exploration.md | ~40-50 lines | ~200-300 lines |
| research-topics.md | ~20-30 lines | expanded with context |
| **Total** | ~60-80 lines | ~200-300 lines |

**Source:** `.cursor/commands/explore.md` (Setup Mode Output, Conduct Mode Output sections)

**Relevance:** These line count guidelines provide concrete targets for template design. Similar targets should be established for other workflows.

---

### Finding 5: Required vs Optional Sections

**Analysis of section patterns reveals required vs optional sections:**

#### Exploration Docs

### Finding 6: Command-Generated vs Manually Created Docs

| Document | Generated By | Generation Mode |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| exploration.md | `/explore` | Setup creates scaffolding, Conduct expands |
| research-topics.md | `/explore` | Setup creates with topics from exploration |
| README.md (exploration hub) | `/explore` | Setup creates |
| research-[topic].md | `/research` | Setup creates template, Conduct fills in |
| research-summary.md | `/research` | Setup creates, updated after each topic |
| requirements.md | `/research` | Setup creates skeleton, Conduct populates |
| README.md (research hub) | `/research` | Setup creates |
| adr-NNN-[name].md | `/decision` | Full generation |
| decisions-summary.md | `/decision` | Creates/updates |
| transition-plan.md | `/transition-plan` | Full generation from ADRs |
| phase-N.md | `/transition-plan` | Creates scaffolding from transition plan |
| feature-plan.md | `/transition-plan` | Creates from ADRs |
| status-and-next-steps.md | `/task-phase` | Creates, auto-updates |
| README.md (feature hub) | `/transition-plan` | Creates |
| handoff.md | `/handoff` (proposed) | Full generation with gathered context |

**Source:** Analysis of `.cursor/commands/explore.md`, `research.md`, and `task-phase.md`

**Relevance:** Understanding generation modes helps design templates - some need scaffolding templates, others need full content templates.

### Finding 7: Priority Indicator Patterns

**Consistent priority indicators across all docs:**

| Indicator | Meaning | Used For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 🔴 High | Critical/blocking | Research topics, tasks, requirements |
| 🟡 Medium | Important but not blocking | Research topics, requirements |
| 🟢 Low | Nice-to-have | Research topics, requirements |

**Status indicators:**

| Indicator | Meaning | Used For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 🔴 Not Started / Scaffolding | Work hasn't begun | Phases, research topics |
| 🟠 In Progress | Work underway | Phases, features |
| 🟡 Analysis / Review | Needs review | Research |
| ✅ Complete / Expanded | Work finished | All docs |

**Source:** Pattern analysis across `admin/explorations/`, `admin/research/`, `admin/planning/`

**Relevance:** Templates must use consistent indicators to enable parsing and validation.

## 🔍 Analysis

Based on the findings, we can now design a comprehensive template system:

**Key Insights:**

- [x] **Insight 1:** There are 17 distinct doc types across 6 workflows that need templates
- [x] **Insight 2:** Five common patterns (status header, quick links, status tables, next steps, related links) should be standardized
- [x] **Insight 3:** Hub-and-spoke is the universal organizational pattern
- [x] **Insight 4:** Line count guidelines exist for `/explore` and should be extended to other workflows
- [x] **Insight 5:** Two-mode generation (scaffolding + expansion) is the emerging pattern
- [x] **Insight 6:** Required sections can be validated; optional sections need placeholder handling
- [x] **Insight 7:** Consistent priority/status indicators enable automation

**Template Categories:**

| Category | Doc Types | Count |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Hub Templates | README.md (4 variants) | 4 |
| Exploration Templates | exploration.md, research-topics.md | 2 |
| Research Templates | research-[topic].md, research-summary.md, requirements.md | 3 |
| Decision Templates | adr-NNN.md, decisions-summary.md, transition-plan.md | 3 |
| Planning Templates | feature-plan.md, phase-N.md, status-and-next-steps.md | 3 |
| Other Templates | handoff.md, fix-review-report.md | 2 |
| **Total** | | **17** |

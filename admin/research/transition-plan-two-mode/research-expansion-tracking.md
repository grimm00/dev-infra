## 🎯 Research Question

How should the command track which phases have been expanded?

**Sub-questions:**
- Should expansion state be in the phase file itself?
- Should there be a separate tracking file?
- How to detect if scaffolding has been manually modified?
- What happens if user manually adds content to scaffolding?

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Identify state tracking approaches used in similar systems
- [ ] Goal 2: Determine pros/cons of in-file vs separate tracking
- [ ] Goal 3: Define detection logic for already-expanded phases
- [ ] Goal 4: Document handling of manual modifications
- [ ] Goal 5: Review how `/research` tracks completion state

---

## 📚 Research Methodology

**Sources:**
- [ ] `/research` command completion tracking
- [ ] Existing phase document status indicators
- [ ] Web search: Document state tracking patterns
- [ ] Migration/scaffolding tools (e.g., Rails, Django)

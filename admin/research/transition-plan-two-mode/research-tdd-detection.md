## 🎯 Research Question

How should the command automatically determine when `--tdd` vs `--no-tdd` applies?

**Sub-questions:**
- What patterns indicate code phases (need TDD)?
- What patterns indicate docs-only phases (skip TDD)?
- Should phase names/content drive detection?
- What's the fallback when detection is ambiguous?

---

## 🔍 Research Goals

- [ ] Goal 1: Identify patterns that distinguish code phases from docs phases
- [ ] Goal 2: Document TDD vs non-TDD task ordering requirements
- [ ] Goal 3: Determine heuristics for automatic detection
- [ ] Goal 4: Define fallback behavior for ambiguous cases
- [ ] Goal 5: Review how `/task-phase` handles TDD ordering

**Sources:**
- [ ] Current `/transition-plan` TDD ordering logic
- [ ] `/task-phase` command: TDD task ordering patterns
- [ ] Existing phase documents with TDD ordering
- [ ] Web search: TDD automation detection patterns

## 📊 Overview

This directory tracks project-wide fix batches that span multiple features or PRs. These are created from `/fix-review` analysis of deferred tasks.

**Why project-wide fixes?**

- Deferred tasks often accumulate across multiple PRs
- Similar issues can be batched together efficiently
- Cross-feature improvements benefit from centralized tracking

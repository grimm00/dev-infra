## 📋 Overview

Phase 1 focuses on testing all 14 adapted cursor commands systematically in the dev-infra project. This includes creating test scenarios, validating path detection logic, testing workflows end-to-end, documenting results, and fixing any issues found.

**Goal:** Test all commands systematically in dev-infra project

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] All 14 commands tested
- [ ] All path detection logic validated
- [ ] All workflows tested end-to-end
- [ ] All issues fixed
- [ ] Test results documented

---

## 📅 Tasks

### 1. Create Test Scenarios for Each Command

- [ ] Document test scenarios for Phase 1 commands (`/fix-plan`, `/fix-implement`, `/task-phase`, `/pr`)
- [ ] Document test scenarios for Phase 2 commands (`/fix-review`, `/post-pr`, `/pr-validation`, `/reflection-artifacts`)
- [ ] Document test scenarios for Phase 3 commands (`/transition-plan`, `/reflect`, `/pre-phase-review`, `/task-release`, `/cursor-rules`, `/int-opp`)

**Notes:**
- Create test scenarios document
- Cover all command types and use cases
- Include edge cases and error scenarios

---

### 2. Test Path Detection Logic

- [ ] Test feature-specific path detection
- [ ] Test project-wide path detection
- [ ] Test auto-detection logic

**Notes:**
- Verify commands detect correct paths
- Test with different project structures
- Validate auto-detection works correctly

---

### 3. Test Command Workflows End-to-End

- [ ] Test each command with actual project structures
- [ ] Verify commands produce expected outputs
- [ ] Validate file creation and updates

**Notes:**
- Test complete workflows, not just individual steps
- Verify outputs match expected results
- Check file creation and updates are correct

---

### 4. Document Test Results

- [ ] Create test results document
- [ ] Document any issues found
- [ ] Document successful test cases

**Notes:**
- Create comprehensive test results document
- Document all issues found during testing
- Document successful test cases for reference

---

### 5. Fix Any Issues Found

- [ ] Address path detection issues
- [ ] Fix workflow problems
- [ ] Update command documentation if needed

**Notes:**
- Fix all issues found during testing
- Update command documentation if changes made
- Verify fixes resolve issues

---

## 📦 Deliverables

- Test scenarios document
- Test results document
- Issues list (if any)
- Fixes applied

---

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] All 14 commands tested
- [ ] All path detection logic validated
- [ ] All workflows tested end-to-end
- [ ] All issues fixed
- [ ] Test results documented

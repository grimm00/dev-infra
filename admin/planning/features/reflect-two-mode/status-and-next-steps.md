### Evaluation (First Priority)

1. [ ] Review recent reflection documents for output consistency
2. [ ] Assess whether scaffolding would add value

### If Approved

1. [ ] Define structure vs content boundaries
2. [ ] Implement two-mode pattern

### If Not Approved

1. [ ] Update status to "Won't Implement"
2. [ ] Document reasoning

## 📝 Notes

- Source reflection suggests this may NOT be needed
- Reflections are naturally iterative
- LOW priority - implement last (if at all)

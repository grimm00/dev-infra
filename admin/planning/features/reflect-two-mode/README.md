## 🎯 Feature Overview

Evaluate whether `/reflect` would benefit from Setup + Expand pattern.

**Note:** The source reflection indicates this may NOT be needed because reflections are already naturally iterative. This feature should be evaluated before implementation.

---

## ⚠️ Evaluation Needed

**Questions to answer:**
1. Does `/reflect` produce consistent output sizes?
2. Would a scaffolding step add value?
3. Are reflections already naturally iterative?

**If evaluation shows two-mode is not beneficial:**
- Mark this feature as "Won't Implement"
- Document reasoning

## 📊 Feature Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| Evaluation | Assess Need | 🔴 Not Started | ~30 min |
| Phase 1 | Design | 🔴 Not Started | ~1 hour |
| Phase 2 | Implementation | 🔴 Not Started | ~1 hour |

**Total Estimated Effort:** ~2.5 hours (if implemented)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Evaluate whether two-mode pattern is beneficial for `/reflect`
2. If beneficial, proceed with implementation
3. If not beneficial, mark as "Won't Implement"

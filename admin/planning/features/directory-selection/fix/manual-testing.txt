Iteration: [Description: [SubDesc]]

1:
- For a path that doesn't exist, it still fails silently.
---- This must also mean that the option to create new directory is also failing

- project name, of course, does not take spaces, but just reprompts for project name
---- There should be clarity to the user as to why this is (spaces are not accepted)
---- We can offer the ability replace the name with one that replaces spaces with dashes

- When repos are created, gh repo create should check against the author name given.
---- Logic should be applied when dealing with a machine with multiple accounts logged in
---- I think an gh auth command should be used to check against given author name, whatever is best
---- Overall, for the sake of repo creation with gh, much care should be taken to understand what credentials are being used.

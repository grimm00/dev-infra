## 📋 Overview

Phase 1 focuses on documenting the adaptation pattern that emerged during cursor commands integration. This includes documenting the pattern structure, each step in detail, providing examples from actual adaptations, and documenting best practices.

**Goal:** Document the adaptation pattern that emerged

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Pattern structure documented
- [ ] Each step documented in detail
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Best practices documented

---

## 📅 Tasks

### 1. Document Adaptation Pattern Structure

- [x] Document: Configuration → Path Detection → Feature Detection → Generic Implementation
- [x] Document each step in detail
- [x] Document pattern rationale

**Notes:**

- Document the complete pattern structure
- Explain each step clearly
- Document why this pattern works

---

### 2. Document Each Step in Detail

- [x] Configuration step: Generic paths, configurable options
- [x] Path Detection step: Feature-specific vs project-wide
- [x] Feature Detection step: Auto-detection logic
- [x] Generic Implementation step: Template-agnostic code

**Notes:**

- Document each step thoroughly
- Explain how each step works
- Provide clear examples

---

### 3. Provide Examples from Actual Adaptations

- [x] Extract examples from `/fix-plan` adaptation
- [x] Extract examples from `/pr` adaptation
- [x] Extract examples from `/reflect` adaptation
- [x] Show before/after comparisons

**Notes:**

- Use real examples from actual adaptations
- Show before/after comparisons
- Make examples clear and practical

---

### 4. Document Best Practices

- [x] Document common pitfalls
- [x] Document success factors
- [x] Document validation approaches

**Notes:**

- Document what to avoid
- Document what works well
- Document how to validate adaptations

---

## 📦 Deliverables

- Adaptation pattern document
- Pattern structure documentation
- Examples from command adaptations

---

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] Pattern structure documented
- [ ] Each step documented in detail
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Best practices documented

## 🎯 Overview

Implement standardized release readiness assessment and automation for dev-infra. This feature standardizes release readiness criteria, implements phased automation, creates assessment structure, integrates with release workflow, and adds historical tracking.

**Context:**
- Research completed on 5 topics related to release readiness
- 5 ADRs created with decisions on implementation approach
- Current manual assessments exist but need standardization and automation
- Release workflow commands (`/task-release`, `/pr --release`) need integration

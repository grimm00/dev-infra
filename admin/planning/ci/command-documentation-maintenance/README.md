## 📋 Overview

This topic tracks improvements and maintenance to the Cursor command system. This includes:

- Command documentation updates
- Command workflow improvements
- Command integration enhancements
- Command system maintenance

**Key Principle:** Command documentation updates are documentation-only changes that can be merged directly to `develop` without PRs, but should be tracked here for visibility and coordination.

---

## 🔄 Workflow Pattern

**For command documentation updates:**

1. **Create docs branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b docs/command-docs-[topic]
   ```

2. **Make documentation changes:**
   - Update `.cursor/commands/[command-name].md` files
   - Update related documentation

3. **Create tracking document:**
   - Location: `admin/planning/ci/command-documentation-maintenance/updates/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md`
   - Document what changed and why
   - Link to related topics/improvements

4. **Update this README:**
   - Add entry to "Recent Updates" section
   - Update "Last Updated" date

5. **Commit and merge:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs(commands): [description]"
   git push origin docs/command-docs-[topic]
   git checkout develop
   git merge --ff-only docs/command-docs-[topic]
   git push origin develop
   git branch -d docs/command-docs-[topic]
   ```

**Note:** This is a docs-only workflow - no PR needed. Changes merge directly to `develop`.

## 📊 Recent Updates

### 2025-12-15: Release Workflow Clarification (MEDIUM)

**Branch:** `docs/release-workflow-clarification`  
**Status:** ✅ Applied to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `release-prep`, `release-finalize`, `task-release`

**Changes:**
- **CLARIFIED:** When `/task-release` is needed vs when to skip to `/release-finalize`
- **UPDATED:** Workflow diagrams in all three commands show conditional path
- **NEW:** Added "When to Use" and "When NOT to Use" sections to `/task-release`
- **NEW:** Added decision guides for the branch point

**Impact:**
- Clearer release workflow documentation
- Saves time on releases that don't need `/task-release`
- Prevents confusion about command purpose
- Examples: v1.4.0 used `/task-release`, v1.6.0 skipped it

**Root Cause:**
- User question: "Is task-release obsolete?"
- v1.6.0 completed without using `/task-release`
- Original docs implied `/task-release` was always required
- In practice, only needed for releases with implementation work

**Details:** [2025-12-15-release-workflow-clarification.md](updates/2025-12-15-release-workflow-clarification.md)

### 2025-12-15: Transition Plan TDD Task Ordering (MEDIUM)

**Branch:** `docs/transition-plan-tdd-ordering`  
**Status:** ✅ Applied to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `transition-plan`

**Changes:**
- **NEW:** Added explicit TDD task ordering guidance (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **NEW:** Added example TDD task order in "Key sections to populate"
- **NEW:** Added "Task Ordering Patterns" table for different phase types
- **NEW:** Added decision guide: "What needs to exist first for TDD to work?"
- **ENHANCED:** Documentation phases now have clear ordering guidance

**Impact:**
- Phase documents generated by `/transition-plan` will have properly ordered tasks
- Pre-phase reviews won't need to recommend task reordering
- Clear guidance for TDD, scripts, documentation, and configuration phases

**Root Cause:**
- Phase 4 pre-phase review recommended reordering tasks (1→3→4→5→2→6)
- Command mentioned TDD but didn't enforce task ordering
- Manual reordering added extra work during planning

**Details:** [2025-12-15-transition-plan-tdd-task-ordering.md](updates/2025-12-15-transition-plan-tdd-task-ordering.md)

### 2025-12-15: PR Validation Manual Testing Guide Enforcement (MEDIUM)

**Branch:** `docs/pr-validation-manual-testing`  
**Status:** ✅ Applied to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `pr-validation`

**Changes:**
- **NEW:** Added clear purpose statement - manual testing guides are for HUMAN users, not AI
- **NEW:** Added Section 2a: Check if manual testing guide exists (STOP if missing)
- **NEW:** Added Section 2b: Complete template for creating manual testing guides
- **NEW:** Added key principles for writing human-readable guides
- **MODIFIED:** Restructured Step 2 into 2a/2b/2c sub-sections

**Impact:**
- Manual testing guides now enforced for feature PRs
- Clear distinction: guides are for HUMANS, not AI agent checklists
- Template provided for creating new guides
- Guides must cover ALL completed phases, not just current

**Root Cause:**
- User feedback: "Manual testing guide must be done so the user can use it, not just the AI agent running tests locally"
- Command treated manual testing as AI-run local tests
- No check for guide existence, no template for creation

**Details:** [2025-12-15-pr-validation-manual-testing-guide-enforcement.md](updates/2025-12-15-pr-validation-manual-testing-guide-enforcement.md)

### 2025-12-11: Release Finalize & Post-Release Commands (MEDIUM)

**Branch:** `docs/release-commands`  
**Status:** ✅ Applied to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `release-finalize` (NEW), `post-release` (NEW)

**Changes:**
- **NEW:** Created `/release-finalize` command for finalizing release documents
  - Merges CHANGELOG draft into CHANGELOG.md
  - Finalizes release notes (updates status/date)
  - Scans for version references
  - Updates readiness checklist
  - Options: `--dry-run`, `--changelog-only`, `--skip-branch`, `--date`

- **NEW:** Created `/post-release` command for post-release cleanup
  - Merges main back to develop
  - Updates historical tracking (`analyze-releases.sh`)
  - Archives release documents
  - Cleans up release branch
  - Creates retrospective (optional)
  - Options: `--dry-run`, `--skip-retrospective`, `--keep-branch`

**Impact:**
- Complete release workflow: `/release-prep` → `/release-finalize` → `/pr --release` → `/post-release`
- Fills gap between draft generation and PR creation
- Adds post-release cleanup and tracking
- Consistent release process across versions

**Root Cause:**
- Gap identified: CHANGELOG merge was manual step
- Missing command: No post-release automation
- User question: "Is there anything more we can do to guide AI through this process?"

**Details:** 
- [2025-12-11-release-finalize-command.md](updates/2025-12-11-release-finalize-command.md)
- [2025-12-11-post-release-command.md](updates/2025-12-11-post-release-command.md)

### 2025-12-10: Release Prep Command (MEDIUM)

**Branch:** `docs/release-prep-command`  
**Status:** ✅ Applied to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `release-prep` (NEW)

**Changes:**
- **NEW:** Created `/release-prep` command for release preparation orchestration
- Automates: readiness check, assessment generation, CHANGELOG draft, release notes draft
- Integrates with existing release scripts (`check-release-readiness.sh`, `create-release-branch.sh`)
- Options: `--dry-run`, `--skip-branch`, `--assessment-only`, `--force`

**Impact:**
- Single command for release preparation (was manual multi-step process)
- Consistent document generation across releases
- Completes release command workflow: `/release-prep` → `/task-release` → `/pr --release`

**Root Cause:**
- Release preparation was manual and fragmented
- Scripts existed but weren't orchestrated
- Gap in command workflow between feature completion and release tasks

**Details:** [2025-12-10-release-prep-command.md](updates/2025-12-10-release-prep-command.md)

### 2025-12-10: Address Review Command (MEDIUM)

**Branch:** `docs/address-review-command`  
**Status:** ✅ Applied to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `address-review` (NEW), `task-phase` (MODIFIED)

**Changes:**
- **NEW:** Created `/address-review` command for addressing pre-phase review gaps
- **MODIFIED:** Removed `--from-review` from `/task-phase` (separation of concerns)
- **MODIFIED:** Updated `/task-phase` with "Pre-Phase Review Workflow" section
- Separates planning/documentation updates from implementation

**Impact:**
- Clearer workflow: `/pre-phase-review` → `/address-review` → `/task-phase`
- Single responsibility: Each command does one thing well
- Better control: Can address gaps without starting implementation
- Supersedes the previous `--from-review` integration

**Root Cause:**
- User feedback: Implementation should be kept separate from planning/doc updating
- `--from-review` combined two concerns into one command
- Better design: Three separate commands for three separate steps

**Details:** [2025-12-10-address-review-command.md](updates/2025-12-10-address-review-command.md)

### 2025-12-09: PR Validation Conditional Manual Testing (MEDIUM)

**Branch:** `docs/pr-validation-conditional-manual-testing`  
**Status:** ✅ Applied to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `pr-validation`

**Changes:**
- **NEW:** Added "Step 1e: Determine Manual Testing Applicability"
- Manual testing now **conditional** based on PR type/branch
- Auto-detect: `docs/*`, `chore/*`, `ci/*` PRs skip manual testing
- Auto-detect: `feat/*`, `fix/*` PRs require manual testing
- File change analysis for edge cases
- Added `--force-manual-testing` override flag

**Impact:**
- `docs/chore/ci` PRs skip manual testing automatically
- `feat/fix` PRs require manual testing (as before)
- Reduces unnecessary manual testing documentation
- User informed of determination with override option

**Root Cause:**
- PR #35 validation revealed manual testing was mandatory for all PRs
- Not all PRs have user-facing functionality to test
- Creating empty manual testing guides is wasteful

**Details:** [2025-12-09-pr-validation-conditional-manual-testing.md](updates/2025-12-09-pr-validation-conditional-manual-testing.md)

### 2025-12-09: PR Branch Detection (HIGH)

**Branch:** `docs/pr-branch-detection`  
**Status:** ✅ Applied to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `pr`

**Changes:**
- **NEW:** Added "Pre-Command Branch Validation (BLOCKING)" section
- Branch pattern detection for phase/fix/release PRs
- Worktree awareness - detects if branch is in different worktree
- Clear resolution guidance for branch mismatches
- Auto-detection logic for expected branch patterns

**Impact:**
- Prevents PR creation from wrong branch/location
- Guides user to correct worktree when applicable
- Provides actionable resolution steps

**Root Cause:**
- `/pr --phase 3` failed because on `develop` not feature branch
- Feature branch was in worktree, not main workspace
- No detection or guidance to correct location

**Details:** [2025-12-09-pr-branch-detection.md](updates/2025-12-09-pr-branch-detection.md)

### 2025-12-09: Task Phase Branch Validation (HIGH)

**Branch:** `docs/task-phase-branch-validation`  
**Status:** ✅ Applied to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `task-phase`

**Changes:**
- **NEW:** Added "Pre-Task Branch Validation (BLOCKING)" section
- Branch pattern validation before any work begins
- Worktree conflict detection and handling
- Auto-status update integration for task completion
- Commit location verification (ensure on feature branch, not develop)

**Impact:**
- Prevents commits going to wrong branch
- Ensures task checkboxes are marked complete automatically
- Handles worktree scenarios gracefully

**Root Cause:**
- Phase 3 Task 3 commits went to `develop` instead of feature branch
- Phase document not updated because working in wrong context
- Worktree conflict prevented branch checkout

**Details:** [2025-12-09-task-phase-branch-validation.md](updates/2025-12-09-task-phase-branch-validation.md)

### 2025-12-09: Fix Implement PR Status Check (CRITICAL)

**Branch:** `docs/fix-implement-pr-status-check`  
**Status:** ✅ Merged to develop  
**Commands Affected:** `fix-implement`

**Changes:**
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Added PR status check before deciding workflow
- HIGH/CRITICAL fixes now push to existing open PR (not create new PR)
- MEDIUM/LOW fixes or merged PRs create new PR (post-merge fixes)
- Prevents workflow fragmentation and ensures correct PR semantics

**Impact:**
- Fixes critical workflow issue where HIGH priority fixes were split into separate PRs
- Example: PR #32 → Should have 1 PR with all fixes, not 3 separate PRs

**Related Topics:**
- Workflow Issue Documentation (`admin/planning/notes/workflow-issue-fix-implement-pr-handling.md`)
- PR #32, #33, #34 resolution

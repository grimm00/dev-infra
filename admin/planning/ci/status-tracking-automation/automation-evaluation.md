**Purpose:** Evaluate automated status tracking options for status update process  
**Status:** 🟠 In Progress  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-07

---

## 📋 Overview

This document evaluates automation options for status tracking, including GitHub Actions workflows, CI/CD integration, command enhancements, and custom scripts. The goal is to determine if automation is justified and which approach would be most effective.

**Current State:**
- Status updates are manual but well-documented
- Status updates are mandatory but lenient (warnings, not blockers)
- Status updates integrated into PR workflow (creation, review, merge)
- `/post-pr` command already automates post-merge status updates

---

## 🔍 Automation Options Evaluation

### Option 1: GitHub Actions Workflows

**Approach:** Create GitHub Actions workflows to automatically update status documents

**Potential Workflows:**

1. **PR Merge Triggered Status Updates**
   - Trigger: `on: pull_request: types: [closed]` (when merged)
   - Action: Update phase document status to "✅ Complete"
   - Action: Update feature status document
   - Action: Commit changes to repository

2. **PR Creation Triggered Status Validation**
   - Trigger: `on: pull_request: types: [opened, synchronize]`
   - Action: Validate phase document status
   - Action: Validate feature status document
   - Action: Post PR comment if status outdated

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fully automated after setup
- ✅ No manual intervention needed
- ✅ Consistent status updates
- ✅ Can validate status automatically

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires write permissions to repository
- ❌ May conflict with manual updates
- ❌ Complex to handle edge cases (multiple phases, feature detection)
- ❌ Maintenance burden (workflow updates)
- ❌ May be over-engineered for current needs

**Implementation Complexity:** High
**Maintenance Burden:** Medium-High
**Reliability:** Medium (depends on GitHub Actions availability)

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **Not Recommended** - Current manual process with `/post-pr` automation is sufficient. GitHub Actions would add complexity without significant benefit.

---

### Option 2: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Approach:** Integrate status updates into existing CI/CD pipelines

**Potential Integration:**

1. **Status Validation in Test Workflow**
   - Add status check step to `.github/workflows/test.yml`
   - Validate status documents before tests run
   - Fail workflow if status outdated (strict) or warn (lenient)

2. **Status Updates in Release Workflow**
   - Add status update step to `.github/workflows/release-distribution.yml`
   - Update status documents as part of release process

**Pros:**
- ✅ Integrates with existing workflows
- ✅ Can validate status as part of CI
- ✅ Consistent with other automation

**Cons:**
- ❌ CI/CD workflows are for testing/release, not documentation updates
- ❌ May slow down CI pipeline
- ❌ Requires write permissions
- ❌ May conflict with manual updates
- ❌ Adds complexity to CI workflows

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium-High
**Maintenance Burden:** Medium
**Reliability:** Medium

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **Not Recommended** - CI/CD workflows should focus on testing and release, not documentation updates. Mixing concerns reduces clarity.

### Option 3: Command Enhancements for Auto-Status

**Approach:** Enhance existing commands to automatically update status

**Potential Enhancements:**

1. **Enhance `/task-phase` Command**
   - Auto-update phase status to "🟠 In Progress" at phase start
   - Auto-update task checkboxes as tasks complete
   - Auto-update phase status to "✅ Complete" at phase completion

2. **Enhance `/post-pr` Command**
   - Already updates status automatically (✅ implemented)
   - Could enhance to detect and update more status fields

3. **Enhance `/pr` Command**
   - Auto-update status before PR creation if outdated
   - Auto-commit status updates as part of PR creation

**Pros:**
- ✅ Integrates with existing workflow

- ✅ Developer-controlled (explicit commands)
- ✅ Can be incremental (enhance one command at a time)
- ✅ Lower maintenance burden

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Still requires developer to run commands
- ⚠️ May not catch all status update opportunities
- ⚠️ Requires command modifications

**Implementation Complexity:** Low-Medium
**Maintenance Burden:** Low
**Reliability:** High (commands already exist and work)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Recommended** - Enhance existing commands incrementally. This approach:
- Builds on existing infrastructure
- Maintains developer control
- Can be implemented incrementally
- Low maintenance burden
- High reliability

**Specific Enhancements to Consider:**

1. **`/task-phase` Auto-Status:**
   - Auto-update phase status at phase start
   - Auto-update task checkboxes (already manual, could prompt)
   - Auto-update phase status at completion

2. **`/pr` Auto-Status:**
   - Auto-detect outdated status before PR creation
   - Prompt to update status or auto-update
   - Auto-commit status updates if made

3. **`/post-pr` Enhancements:**
   - Already automates post-merge updates (✅ working)
   - Could enhance to detect more status fields
   - Could enhance to update more documents

---

### Option 4: Custom Scripts

**Approach:** Create custom scripts for status updates

**Potential Scripts:**

1. **Status Update Script**
   - Script: `scripts/update-status.sh`
   - Function: Update phase/feature status documents
   - Usage: Run manually or integrate into commands

2. **Status Validation Script**
   - Script: `scripts/validate-status.sh`
   - Function: Validate status documents are current
   - Usage: Run in CI or manually

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control over behavior
- ✅ Can be customized for specific needs
- ✅ Can be integrated into commands or CI

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires script development and maintenance
- ❌ May duplicate command functionality
- ❌ Additional tooling to maintain
- ❌ May not be used consistently

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium
**Maintenance Burden:** Medium
**Reliability:** Medium (depends on script quality)

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **Not Recommended** - Commands already provide this functionality. Adding scripts would duplicate effort and add maintenance burden.

## 💭 Conclusion

**Current State Assessment:**

The status tracking process is **well-automated** for post-merge updates (`/post-pr` command) and **well-documented** for manual updates during work. The process is **mandatory but lenient**, allowing for iterative improvement.

**Automation Recommendation:**

**Incremental command enhancements** are recommended over external automation (GitHub Actions, CI/CD integration). This approach:
- Builds on existing infrastructure
- Maintains developer control
- Can be implemented incrementally
- Low maintenance burden
- High reliability

**Priority:**

1. **High Priority:** Enhance `/task-phase` command for auto-status (highest value)

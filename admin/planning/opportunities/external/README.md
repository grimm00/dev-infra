## 🎯 Overview

This directory captures valuable patterns, improvements, and learnings discovered during implementation of external projects. These opportunities inform dev-infra template improvements and best practices.

**Organization:** Opportunities are grouped by source project (e.g., `work-prod/`) to maintain clear lineage and context.

### How External Opportunities Work

1. **Discovery** - Patterns identified during real project implementation
2. **Documentation** - Learnings captured in opportunity documents
3. **Prioritization** - Opportunities assessed by priority, impact, and effort
4. **Application** - High-priority items applied to dev-infra templates
5. **Validation** - Updated templates tested with new projects

# proj-cli Learnings - Template Generation Phase 2: Local Registry

**Project:** proj-cli  
**Topic:** Template Generation Phase 2 - Local Registry  
**Date:** 2026-01-05  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-05

---

## 📋 Overview

Phase 2 created a local registry module to track template-created projects for sync purposes. The registry acts as a minimal overlay that cross-references `inventory.json` (the primary project store). This phase involved significant architectural refinement mid-implementation.

**PR:** #10 (merged 2026-01-05)
**Duration:** ~3 hours (including architectural refinement)
**Tests:** 22 passing

## ✅ What Worked Exceptionally Well

### 1. Dataclasses for Simple Models

**Why it worked:**
Using Python dataclasses (instead of Pydantic) for `RegistryProject` and `Registry` kept the models lightweight and focused.

**What made it successful:**
- No validation overhead needed (data comes from trusted sources)
- Clear, simple data structures
- Easy JSON serialization with custom functions

**Template implications:**
- Recommend dataclasses for internal data models
- Reserve Pydantic for user-facing configuration

**Key examples:**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

@dataclass
class RegistryProject:
    """Minimal schema - only sync-related fields."""
    path: Path  # Cross-reference key to inventory
    template: str  # Template type used
    template_version: str  # Template version for sync
    created_at: datetime  # When created

@dataclass
class Registry:
    """Sync overlay, not a project store."""
    version: str = "1.0"
    projects: list[RegistryProject] = field(default_factory=list)
```

**Benefits:**
- Simple, readable code
- No external dependencies for models
- Easy to test

---

### 2. Pre-Merge Fix Pattern (Sourcery Workflow)

**Why it worked:**
Fixing all HIGH priority Sourcery issues before merge resulted in cleaner code and no deferred technical debt.

**What made it successful:**
- PR validation identified 5 issues (4 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM)
- All HIGH issues were LOW effort to fix
- Fixed on the same branch before merge

**Template implications:**
- Document pre-merge fix pattern in workflow docs
- Encourage fixing HIGH priority, LOW effort issues before merge

**Key examples:**
- #1: Updated docstring (removed misleading "atomic write" claim)
- #2: Added path normalization (`.resolve()`)
- #3: Added round-trip test
- Overall-#2: Added Z suffix handling for datetime

**Benefits:**
- No deferred HIGH priority issues
- Cleaner merge
- Better code quality from start

---

### 3. Architectural Refinement Pattern

**Why it worked:**
Identifying overlap between `registry.json` and `inventory.json` mid-phase and refining the architecture before proceeding prevented future rework.

**What made it successful:**
- Paused implementation to analyze overlap
- Used `/transition-plan --update-adr` to document decision
- Simplified `RegistryProject` to minimal schema (4 fields instead of 8)
- Updated phase plan to reflect new architecture

**Template implications:**
- Document architectural refinement workflow
- ADR updates should be part of normal development

**Key decisions:**
- `inventory.json` = Primary project store (all projects, rich metadata)
- `registry.json` = Sync overlay (template projects only, minimal fields)
- Cross-reference via `path` field

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- No duplication between files
- Simpler implementation

---

### 4. Functional Module Design

**Why it worked:**
Using pure functions (`load_registry()`, `save_registry()`, `add_project()`, etc.) instead of a class made the module easy to test and use.

**What made it successful:**
- Each function has single responsibility
- No shared state (loads registry fresh each time)
- Easy to test in isolation

**Template implications:**
- Consider functional design for data persistence modules
- Document functional vs class-based patterns

**Key examples:**

```python
def load_registry() -> Registry:
    """Load registry from disk, creating empty if not exists."""
    ...

def save_registry(registry: Registry) -> None:
    """Save registry to disk."""
    ...

def add_project(path: Path, template: str, template_version: str) -> RegistryProject:
    """Add a new project to the registry."""
    registry = load_registry()
    # ... add project ...
    save_registry(registry)
    return project
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear function contracts
- Easy to test each function
- No hidden state

---

## 🟡 What Needs Improvement

### 1. Path Normalization Oversight

**What the problem was:**
Initial implementation didn't normalize paths with `.resolve()`, causing potential duplicate detection issues with relative vs absolute paths.

**Why it occurred:**
Assumed callers would always pass consistent path formats.

**Impact:**
- Sourcery flagged as HIGH priority
- Required fix before merge

**How to prevent:**
- Always normalize paths at entry points
- Add path format tests (relative, absolute, symlinks)

**Template changes needed:**
- Document path normalization pattern in data modules
- Include path format tests in test templates

**Fix:**

```python
def add_project(path: Path, ...) -> RegistryProject:
    # Normalize path for consistent comparisons
    path = path.resolve()
    ...
```

---

### 2. ISO 8601 Z Suffix Handling

**What the problem was:**
`datetime.fromisoformat()` doesn't accept the `Z` suffix (ISO 8601 UTC indicator) that many JSON APIs use.

**Why it occurred:**
Didn't test with Z-suffix timestamps in test data.

**Impact:**
- Registry files with Z timestamps would fail to load
- Required fix before merge

**How to prevent:**
- Test datetime parsing with various formats
- Document datetime format expectations

**Template changes needed:**
- Include Z suffix test case in datetime parsing examples
- Document datetime format handling

**Fix:**

```python
# Handle Z suffix (ISO 8601 UTC) - fromisoformat doesn't accept it
created_at_str = proj_data["created_at"]
if created_at_str.endswith("Z"):
    created_at_str = created_at_str[:-1] + "+00:00"
created_at = datetime.fromisoformat(created_at_str)
```

---

### 3. Atomic Write Documentation

**What the problem was:**
Docstring claimed "atomic write" but implementation wasn't actually atomic (no temp file pattern).

**Why it occurred:**
Copied docstring pattern without implementing the behavior.

**Impact:**
- Misleading documentation
- Sourcery flagged as HIGH priority

**How to prevent:**
- Review docstrings for accuracy
- Only claim behaviors that are implemented

**Template changes needed:**
- Remove "atomic" from file write docstrings unless implemented
- Or implement temp file + rename pattern

**Fix (simple):**

```python
def save_registry(registry: Registry) -> None:
    """Save registry to disk.
    
    Note: This is not an atomic write. If the process is interrupted,
    the file may be left in a partial state. For this use case (small
    registry files, low-frequency writes), this is acceptable.
    """
```

## 💡 Unexpected Discoveries

### 1. Inventory vs Registry Overlap Analysis

**Finding:**
Stopping to analyze the overlap between `inventory.json` and `registry.json` before completing implementation saved significant rework.

**Why it's valuable:**
- Original plan had registry storing full project metadata
- Analysis revealed registry should only store sync-specific fields
- Simplified `RegistryProject` from 8 fields to 4

**How to leverage:**
- Before implementing data models, analyze existing stores
- Use ADR updates to document architectural refinements
- Don't be afraid to pause and refine architecture

---

### 2. Cross-Reference Pattern Effectiveness

**Finding:**
Using `path` as the cross-reference key between registry and inventory works well because:
- Paths are unique identifiers for local projects
- No need for synthetic IDs
- Easy to verify and debug

**Why it's valuable:**
- Simpler than managing separate ID systems
- Natural key that users understand
- Works with existing inventory structure

**How to leverage:**
- Use natural keys when possible for cross-references
- Document the cross-reference pattern in data model docs

---

### 3. Round-Trip Testing Value

**Finding:**
The round-trip test (`save → load → assert equal`) caught subtle serialization issues that unit tests missed.

**Why it's valuable:**
- Tests full serialization cycle
- Catches datetime format issues
- Catches path format issues
- Verifies real-world usage pattern

**How to leverage:**
- Always add round-trip tests for data persistence
- Test with edge case data (timestamps, paths, unicode)

## 🎯 Commands Needing More Testing

Commands below graduation threshold (< 3 uses):

| Command | Current Uses | Gap | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----|----------|
| `/cursor-rules` | 1 | 2 more needed | HIGH - v0.7.0 |
| `/task-release` | 2 | 1 more needed | MEDIUM |
| `/reflection-artifacts` | 2 | 1 more needed | LOW |

**Next Actions:**
- Use `/cursor-rules` during next rule update cycle
- Use `/task-release` if v0.7.0 has release tasks
- Use `/reflection-artifacts` after next major feature

## 📋 How to Update This Tracker

**After successful command use:**

1. **Update Usage Summary table:**
   - Increment "Uses" count
   - Update "Last Use" date
   - Update "Success Rate" if failure occurred

2. **Add to Detailed Usage Log:**
   ```markdown
   | YYYY-MM-DD | `/command` | Context description | ✅ Success | Evidence link |
   ```

3. **Check Graduation Status:**
   - If uses ≥ 3 and no recent failures → Consider for graduation
   - Update "Graduation Status" column

**Commit message:**
```
docs(commands): update usage tracker - /[command-name]
```
